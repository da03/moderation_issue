Thread Title: Squish Cartoon Coming to Kids WB! Mid-Season Madness 🐛📚

GreenJelly223: Hey Squish fans! Did you guys hear the news? There’s a Squish cartoon in the works and it’s hitting Kids WB’s mid-season lineup! Can’t wait to see our favorite amoeba make the jump from page to screen! 😄

MicrobeMania: No way, this is awesome! Squish has been one of my favorite graphic novel series for my kids. They’re going to freak out! Have they announced who’s behind the animation or any voice actors yet?

AmoebaAmy: OMG, this made my day! I stumbled onto the news on Twitter but wasn’t sure if it was real. I just hope they keep the charm of the comics. The sense of humor in Squish is just right for a cartoon!

ScienceRules45: @MicrobeMania I read that the team behind some of the recent popular cartoons is on board for this. As for voice actors, nothing’s announced yet. I’m crossing my fingers they get some quality talent. Hoping for some great chemistry between Squish, Pod, and Peggy. 🤞

TheComicNerd21: True, voice acting can make or break a cartoon adaptation. I’m a bit skeptical, tbh. Sometimes these transitions lose the spirit of the original material. But I’ll reserve judgment until we get a trailer or something.

ArtsyOwl: Has anyone heard about the art style yet? The simplistic yet expressive style of the books is super charming. Kids WB tends to go for flashier animation, though I hope they keep it close to the spirit of the Squish comics.

HappyMom200: I just hope they tackle the educational aspects well. My kids learned so much about microorganisms from these books while laughing their heads off. It’ll be great for them to watch Squish’s adventures!

BioGeek: Yes! Education through entertainment is the best. I mean, who knew an amoeba could make science this fun? 😅 And considering we’ve all become amateur virologists lately (thanks, 2020), the timing couldn’t be better.

GreenJelly223: For sure, @BioGeek. They have a chance here to really create something that’s as informational as it is entertaining. I also love how the books touch on themes of friendship and acceptance. If they keep that intact, it’s going to be a hit.

MicrobeMania: Anybody have any insider scoop on when we might be getting a peek at the animation or the voice cast? I’m super eager to see anything at this point!

Bacteriophage_: Rumors say a teaser might drop sometime in the spring. 🌼 Keep your eyes peeled and your streaming devices ready!

AmoebaAmy: Well, here’s hoping Kids WB keeps the slime rolling! Can’t wait to see our little squishy buddy in action. Let’s keep this thread updated with any new info!

Thread Title: Squish Premiere Date and Schedule Changes on Kids WB! 📆📺

Bacteriophage_: Hey everyone, big news! The Squish cartoon is set to premiere in mid-March! Clear your calendars and get ready for some amoeba action! Who’s excited? 🎉

CartoonAficionado: Finally, some concrete dates! I’ve been keeping an eye out since our last thread went quiet. Mid-March is sooner than I expected. Also heard about some schedule shake-ups. Looks like Apple and Onion is getting shelved for the Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Not sure how I feel about that one.

AmoebaAmy: Squish is starting soon?! That’s awesome! I’m totally having a viewing party with my kids. But wow, Apple and Onion out for Xiaolin Showdown…nostalgia trip, anyone? I did love that show, but it’s a bit of a genre leap from Apple and Onion. 🌀

RestInToons: RIP The Tom and Jerry Show. Kinda saw that ending coming. And to be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May? I need new cartoons, not just rewinds. But Steven Universe is still a gem, at least. 💎

MicrobeMania: No more Tom and Jerry? That’s the end of an era. Though, to be fair, SU reruns are solid. It’s not every day you get a show that tackles heavy themes with magical aliens. Still, can’t help but hope we get some fresh blood in the lineup eventually.

ScienceRules45: True, new content is key, but at least we have Squish! And with TTG, Gumball, and Johnny Test holding the fort as flagships, I think Kids WB has a pretty balanced mix. Squish might just be the breath of fresh air we need right now.

GreenJelly223: So, mid-March for Squish, that’s great! Does anyone know if that’s going to affect TTG, Gumball, or Johnny Test air times? I know they’re the heavy hitters, just hoping Squish gets a good slot that doesn’t clash.

TheComicNerd21: Haven’t seen anything about time changes for the flagships. I reckon Squish will find its place without much issue. Kids WB tends to do well with scheduling around their mainstays. And let’s face it—TTG is practically unmovable at this point.

HappyMom200: My kids will be over the moon with the return of Xiaolin Showdown. I loved it as a kid, too. It’s going to be a mix of new and old at our house with Squish and the reruns. I think Kids WB might just pull off this balance. Still, hoping those reruns are just placeholders for future original content.

ArtsyOwl: I’m just happy Squish is making its debut! Sure, schedule changes are always a bit of a rollercoaster, but that’s the nature of TV, right? Out with the old, in with the new… and sometimes back in with the old! 😂

Admin5: Friendly reminder to keep industry rumor discussions civil. Looking forward to seeing how Squish is received by the community here! Let’s revisit this thread after the premiere to share our thoughts. And, as always, stay tuned for any further schedule updates from Kids WB.

Write a follow up during the summer, The summer lineup has TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, Xiaolin Showdown, Johnny Test, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons and Craig of the Creek, Also, new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek and Johnny Test return in September
Thread Title: Kids WB Summer Lineup + Fall New Episodes Info! ☀️📺

GreenJelly223: Summer’s heating up, folks, and so is Kids WB’s lineup! We’re looking at TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, and Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Plus, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Craig of the Creek are all part of the mix. How’s everyone feeling about the current programming?

CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, but I’m not complaining! New fans are getting a taste of some classic toons with Xiaolin Showdown, and Squish has been a pleasant surprise—really nailing it. Plus, Craig of the Creek is always solid. It’s like a buffet of different cartoon flavors this summer.

Bacteriophage_: And don’t forget what’s coming in the fall – new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek, and Johnny Test. September can’t come soon enough!

AmoebaAmy: Squish has been an absolute delight! My kids adore it, and it’s turning into our little summer tradition to watch together. As much as I love TTG and Gumball, it’s Squish that has us tuning in with the most excitement.

TheComicNerd21: A heads-up for all the true toon fans out there: new episodes for some of these shows are usually a blast. I’ve got high hopes for the fall, especially for Craig of the Creek—they’ve been consistently knocking it out of the park.

ScienceRules45: I’m just glad we have such variety. Keeps the channel interesting. Summer is always tricky with kids home all day, but this lineup has something for everybody.

ArtsyOwl: Agreed on the variety. The blend of classic and contemporary shows has me responding like I’m five and thirteen all at once. 😆 By the way, the art in the latest season of Looney Tunes Cartoons has been stellar. Can’t wait to see what they do next.

MicrobeMania: I am surprised how well Skatoony holds up. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but the quizzing with cartoons is unique. And with Scooby Doo and Guess Who featured, it feels like we’ve got a bit of a detective theme going on. Or is it just me?

RestInToons: September seems pretty far, but I got a feeling that new Teen Titans Go and Johnny Test episodes will make some serious waves. Ben 10, too, has been gearing up for something big, at least that’s the vibe.

HappyMom200: It’s a stable lineup for sure. Steven Universe reruns are still a hit in my house. Plus, I appreciate the educational value in shows like Squish. Keeps the kids learning even out of school—parents’ summer dream!

Admin5: Great to see such positivity about the lineup! As always, discuss your favorite shows, but please remember no spoilers for unaired episodes. Let’s reconvene in this thread when the new episodes drop in September to share our thoughts and reviews!

Write a follow up where Robotboy is added to the schedule the next year in May 2022 when Summer begins, B10, LTC and SU are leaving, Robotboy, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks are taking their place, Also in the fall, we have a few new shows, Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the bold and Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated, Also a new acquired comedy cartoon about 2 blobs
Thread Title: Kids WB Schedule Shakeup - Hello Robotboy, So Long Ben 10 & Others! 🤖📺

GreenJelly223: Hold onto your remotes, toon fans! Coming up next in May 2022, just as summer kicks off, Kids WB is adding Robotboy to the lineup. It’s a nostalgia hit for sure but sad to see some good ones like Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Steven Universe leave us. Thoughts?

TheComicNerd21: Man, Robotboy brings me back. Haven’t seen that little guy in AGES. Sad to see Ben 10 go; it was always a solid watch. But, this is the life of a cartoon fan, right? Out with the old, in with the… older? 😂

Bacteriophage_: Robotboy’s return is quite a surprise. It had that classic boy-and-his-robot vibe. Also, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks? That’s quite the throwback. For those who don’t remember, Chop Socky Chooks was this wild mix of kung fu and chickens—only in cartoons, folks!

CartoonAficionado: Don’t forget about the fall bonanza! Kids WB is loading up with some heavy hitters—Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated. Plus, that new comedy about two blobs? Can’t find much on it, but new content is always exciting!

AmoebaAmy: Wait, so we’re swapping out some superhero action with… different superhero action, and we’re keeping the mystery with Scooby-Doo. And do I smell a strong comedy theme building up with the two blob cartoon?

RestInToons: Totally digging the superhero update with Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. They bring that comic book essence to the screen. And another comedy about blobs? Guess this one’s the era of the blob, huh?

ArtsyOwl: As much as I’ll miss Steven Universe for its depth and progressivism, I guess I’m ready for something light-hearted. Robotboy and the blob comedy might just be the palate cleanser we need. Here’s hoping they deliver some good laughs!

MicrobeMania: Definitely a bummer about Ben 10 and SU. Those shows had such depth in storytelling and character development. But Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated is not to be slept on. That iteration has some of the best arcs for our mystery-solving gang!

ScienceRules45: Batman: The Brave and the Bold was a gem! It didn’t take itself too seriously and had just the right amount of camp. And with Ultimate Spider-Man, looks like we’ll still be getting our fix of animated superhero action.

HappyMom200: Love the move to Batman and Spider-Man. My kid has been on a real superhero kick, and Scooby-Doo never gets old. At least, not in my household. The blob comedy sounds intriguing—Kids WB isn’t afraid to experiment, that’s for sure!

Admin5: With these cartoon cycles, it’s always sad to see some shows go but equally exciting to welcome new titles and welcome back some classics like Robotboy. Remember, fall is just around the corner, so let’s keep the conversation going when those new shows hit the screen.

Write a follow up where the blob cartoon is revealed to (be one I made up, hopefully I make it as a YouTube series) be named “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Gloopy is a normal slime blob wheras Glitter lives up to her name as a sparkling one, Also, a mid season show Code Lyoko is premiering just as COTC knocks off for Summer, Also promos for CSC are already airing
Thread Title: Revealed: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Joins Kids WB + Code Lyoko Mid-Season Premiere!✨🤖

CartoonAficionado: Alright, the mystery’s solved! The new blob comedy coming to Kids WB is “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. Gloopy is your average slime blob, and Glitter is, well, super sparkly! Could be a hit if it’s done well. Fingers crossed it’s as fun as the name suggests.

GreenJelly223: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” huh? That’s quite the name! I’m all for original content—bringing in some fresh ‘slime’ to the game. Kudos to the creator, especially if they started on YouTube. That’s one giant leap for slime-kind. 😄

TheComicNerd21: Between Gloopy and Glitter, I’m expecting some madcap hijinks and, hopefully, some good chemistry. Pun totally intended! It’s neat seeing creators move from YouTube to big networks. What a time to be alive!

Bacteriophage_: Just saw the promo for Chop Socky Chooks! Honestly, I’d forgotten about that show, but the nostalgia hit me hard. Kids WB really knows how to draw in the old school fans alongside the new ones.

AmoebaAmy: Excited to see what “Gloopy and Glitter” brings to the table! It’s always refreshing to see new characters and stories. Also, did anyone catch that Code Lyoko is coming back as a mid-season show? That’s unexpected! I remember watching that show as a kid—the blend of 2D and 3D animation was so cool.

RestInToons: Code Lyoko? No way! That show was my virtual escape. With Craig of the Creek taking a summer break, Code Lyoko has some big shoes to fill. I’m cautiously optimistic. Also, kudos to the person behind “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. This is indie creators’ dream!

ArtsyOwl: Craig of the Creek is my comfort show, so knowing it’s taking a break has me in my feels. But Code Lyoko might just be the perfect summer binge to replace it. That show was ahead of its time with its virtual world storyline.

MicrobeMania: With Chop Socky Chooks, Code Lyoko, and now “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” I’m sensing a theme of whimsy and adventure. Perfect for a carefree summer! It’s gonna be a wild ride on Kids WB.

ScienceRules45: Indeed, summer is shaping up to be full of adventure and laughs! I’m curious to see the comedic dynamics between Gloopy and Glitter and how they’ll fit into the current lineup. Code Lyoko is an excellent addition for anyone who’s into that sci-fi, virtual reality vibe.

HappyMom200: Just peeped the promo for Gloopy and Glitter with the kids. They’re already quoting lines and chuckling. Also, major props to Kids WB for the diversity in its programming—you’ve got old hits, modern takes, and now a homegrown web series making it to the big leagues.

Admin5: The summer is looking quite adventurous with all the fresh and returning programming we have on our hands! If “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” or Code Lyoko capture your hearts, be sure to come back and let everyone know. Enjoy the shows, everyone, and let’s support those indie creators making waves!

Write a follow up where another mid-season show premieres, replacing Gumball, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers
Thread Title: Mid-Season Update: The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Replace Gumball on Kids WB! 🤩🎪

TheComicNerd21: Big news for Kids WB watchers! “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is premiering mid-season, taking the spot “The Amazing World of Gumball” left behind. I’ve got high hopes that these thrill-seeking siblings will bring the same level of zany to the lineup. Can they live up to the hilarity of Gumball, though? That’s the big question.

GreenJelly223: Gumball’s out?! Say it isn’t so! That show was a staple! But I remember The Adrenalini Brothers from awhile back…they were full of over-the-top stunts and accents. Hopefully, they can fill the quirky cartoon void that’s gonna be left in Gumball’s wake.

CartoonAficionado: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” are pure comedic gold with those daredevil antics. Gumball set a high bar for humor and heart, but if you want outrageous adventures and laughs, the Adrenalinis could be just the ticket.

ArtsyOwl: I admit, I’ll miss the random humor and clever writing of Gumball. It was one of those shows that had something for viewers of all ages. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have a different flavor, but I’m definitely willing to give them a shot.

Bacteriophage_: Well folks, all good things must come to an end, but at least the high-paced energy of The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers might fill the void. They’re not new to the cartoon scene, but let’s hope their stunts are as amazing as ever.

MicrobeMania: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is a throwback! Those guys pull off some wild stunts. Kids WB seems to be aiming for high octane to take Gumball’s place. Keeping my fingers crossed that they keep delivering fresh content, even in the form of older gems getting the spotlight again.

RestInToons: Guess it’s goodbye to Gumball and hello Adrenalini. I remember the brothers having quite the international flair. Their eclectic style should make for a refreshing change of pace. Plus, with Squish and the others, Kids WB’s variety is still on point.

AmoebaAmy: My kids loved Gumball, so they’re a bit gutted. But I think The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ daredevil acts might just win them over. I’m always down for more shenanigans. Here’s hoping they get as much character-driven hilarity as Gumball had.

ScienceRules45: Gumball’s creativity was unmatched, but The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers? That’s a nostalgia trip! Will be interesting to see how a show that’s been off the radar for a while resonates with the current audience.

HappyMom200: My Gumball marathon nights are coming to an end it seems. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have some big shoes to fill, but I’m ready for the laughs. In Kids WB we trust, right? 😂

Admin5: Change is part of every TV network’s lifecycle. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could be what kids WB needs to shake things up. Let’s give these fearless brothers a chance and reconvene here to discuss the stunts, humor, and how the show fits into the new dynamic!

Write a follow up in fall when the new shows premiere, Lyoko is sticking around, Gumball and Craig are back, but won’t be for long, leaving again in January, Also, a user says Skatoony will definitely be back next year, as it has been a summer replacement show since 2018
Thread Title: Fall Premieres are Here! Welcome Back Craig & Gumball + Code Lyoko Stays! 🍂📺

GreenJelly223: It’s fall premiere season, everyone! And with the leaves changing comes new changes to Kids WB. Code Lyoko has secured its spot on the schedule, which I know some of you are thrilled about. The Amazing World of Gumball and Craig of the Creek are making a short-lived comeback, dipping out again in January. Can’t get enough of those two, so I’m here for any time they’re on.

CartoonAficionado: Great to have Gumball and Craig back, even if it’s just for a quick hello and goodbye. It’s like that favorite seasonal dish you can’t stop craving. And Code Lyoko sticking around? Love that for us—those virtual vibes aren’t going anywhere!

TheComicNerd21: Ah, the temporary returns of Gumball and Craig are bittersweet. Makes you wish they’d just stick around full-time. But, I gotta say, Code Lyoko keeping its slot is A-okay with me. That’s one show I’ve been seriously getting back into.

ArtsyOwl: The quality storytelling in Craig of the Creek will be sorely missed once January rolls around. And Gumball—it just has that rewatchability factor like no other. Soak it up while you can, folks!

MicrobeMania: Just dropping in to say that Skatoony is going to be back next summer, and I’m here for it! It’s kind of become the unofficial summer tradition since 2018, hasn’t it? Always great to see a show that knows how to fill its seasonal shoes.

Bacteriophage_: Yeah, Skatoony’s like that cool summer camp you get excited about all year. But let’s not overlook the fall newcomers too—I’m already setting reminders for Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The superhero binge is real!

RestInToons: Mixed feelings about the short-term return of Gumball and Craig of the Creek. At least we know Kids WB is good at giving us something to look forward to. As for Code Lyoko, it’s been interesting to see a show from yesteryear find its groove with the audience today.

AmoebaAmy: The limited time with Gumball and Craig is better than no time! Let’s enjoy the laughs and adventures while they last. And happy to have confirmed scoops like the one about Skatoony return—it’s this kind of knowledge that keeps the fandom ticking.

ScienceRules45: I’ve gotten used to the shift and shuffle of Kids WB’s schedule. You learn to appreciate what you’ve got when you’ve got it. That said, I’m diving headfirst into the nostalgia and newness of this fall’s lineup. It’s going to be an entertaining season!

HappyMom200: I’m grateful for any sprinkles of Craig of the Creek episodes we get! It’s such a gem. And does anyone else get way too competitive watching Skatoony, or is that just me? 😂 Super stoked about its return next year!

Admin5: Some very astute observations and a tangible excitement for the new and returning shows this fall! Let’s enjoy this season’s offerings, and, as always, keep the conversations engaging as we head into the new year with all its sure-to-be-surprising programming and inevitable farewells.

Write a follow up in 2023 where G&G are still rerunning, but Batman, Scooby and Spidey are off, replaced with Ozzy and Drix, World of Quest and Skatoony for summer
Thread Title: 2023 Kids WB Update: Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest & Skatoony Take Over Summer! 🌞👾

GreenJelly223: Hey toon enthusiasts! As we hit the sunny stride of 2023, Kids WB is switching up the schedule. We’re saying bye to Batman, Scooby, and Spidey. But don’t despair—Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest, and the ever-reliable Skatoony are here for those summer vibes. Also, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are still doing the rerun rounds. Keeping it fresh and funky!

CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s cool to see Ozzy & Drix making a comeback. That show was always under the radar but it delivered some solid laughs plus a bit of body-function education. Let’s see how it holds up today!

TheComicNerd21: No more Batman and Spidey is a bummer, but you know what? Bring on the Ozzy & Drix and World of Quest! I remember World of Quest being pretty out there with its humor, a good mix of action and oddball characters—definitely fitting for the wacky tone of summer.

MicrobeMania: Ozzy & Drix, that’s a throwback! I had a feeling it could make a resurgence. Educational and entertaining—that’s a tough balance to strike, but that show had it. Also, cheers to year 5 of summer Skatoony—it’s tradition at this point!

ArtsyOwl: Hey, “Gloopy and Glitter” are still in the reruns, too! Shimmering on—quite literally, thanks to Glitter. It’s a quirky and cute show, glad it’s still around for the little ones to enjoy.

Bacteriophage_: Seeing World of Quest drop into the lineup makes me hopeful that Kids WB is dedicated to keeping variety alive. Adventure, humor, outright weirdness—it’s got it all. And combined with the educational fun from Ozzy & Drix, plus the game show laughs from Skatoony? Count me in for the summer!

RestInToons: Sayonara superheroes! This season’s lineup shows that kids’ programming isn’t just about capes and villains. It’s about variety, surprise, and a touch of nostalgia. Let’s get microscopic with Ozzy & Drix and go on a wild ride with Quest and Nestor!

AmoebaAmy: Always a tad sad to see the Scooby gang go, but switching up genres keeps things interesting. Ozzy & Drix is kind of like “The Magic School Bus” for the older crowd, and I’m here for it! Plus, Skatoony is something my kids look forward to every year—glad it’s not going anywhere!

ScienceRules45: I’ve got to say, I appreciate how Kids WB keeps mixing in educational content amidst all the comedy and action. Ozzy & Drix is a blast from the past that I’m excited to revisit. It’s just what we need in a world that could use a refresher on health and the human body!

HappyMom200: World of Quest is an underrated treasure, and I’m thrilled it’s coming back into the spotlight. It’s like that fun summer book series but animated. And Skatoony is practically synonymous with summer now; glad to know some things stay solid.

Admin5: The summer outlook is looking diverse and delightful! With shows that cater to every kind of young fan, there’s no shortage of entertainment. Let’s keep track of these changes and see how they fare in the warm months ahead. Enjoy your summer watching, and stay tuned for updates on what’s next!

January 27 2024

Should have seen this coming the day TAWOG and COTC left for good, but Kids WB died on December 30, We now have the CW4Kids, owned by 4Kids Entertainment, and the first schedule change has happened, Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have been replaced with Pokemon: Indigo League and Sonic X respectively, The block still has the Kids WB aesthetic, but I expect that to be gone by Easter, Also, another schedule change is coming in a few months, Teen Titans Go, Scooby Doo Mystery Inc and Batman the Brave and the Bold are being replaced with GoGoRiki (Smeshariki), Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya in 2 weeks, The remaining KWB shows as of now are Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider Man (and in 2 weeks, Gloopy and Glitter). The way they went about this was interesting, In December they started airing promos saying that from January 7 the network would be changing it’s name, it didn’t tell us that 4Kids are now in charge or that there would be new shows, the promo just showed the usual KWB shows like Squish, TAAB, TTG, XS, etc. Also today the promo for the next schedule change (dubbed a Super Duper Late Winter Lineup) has a new slogan “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Slow and painful rebrand? 😒, If you’re not gonna change the bumpers untill Easter then why reveal your flashy new slogan now. Also the website (thecw4kids.com) STILL says this at the footer “© 2024 Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Global, Nexstar Media Group” Hopefully it is updated to reflect 4Kids’s involvement soon. Write a follow up forum convo where they talk more about the slow transition, and that GoGoRiki is cute, and that it could be primed to take over most of the current comedy cartoons
Thread Title: CW4Kids: A Slow Transition & The Future of Cartoons on the Block? 🔄📺

ToonMasterJay: So, has anyone else noticed how the CW4Kids transition is kinda like watching paint dry? The bumpers feel like Kids WB is haunting us. And they’re dropping their new slogan already, but the website footer is still all about the old guard… Mixed signals much?

DigitalToonFan: Yeah, the transition is definitely dragging its feet. I mean, if you’re going to bring in 4Kids, then do it with a bang! Not this half-Zoom half-real-life meeting vibe. The new lineup switches could be cool though, but I’ll miss Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers for sure.

GoGoFan223: Honestly, I’m most excited about GoGoRiki (or Smeshariki for the purists). It’s cute and has that potential to be big with the comedy crowd. Less about the action and more laughs—could be the perfect fit for the new direction they’re aiming for.

SonicXforever: Still processing the swap of Squish for Pokémon and TAAB for Sonic X… I mean, sure, classics! But Sonic X has been rerun how many times now? I guess they’re banking on that nostalgia factor to reel us in while they’re redecorating.

PokeNostalgia101: Not going to lie, I’m excited to have Pokémon Indigo League back—it’s like comfort food for my soul. But I hear you all, the change is weirdly slow. I get that it’s a big shift from Kids WB to full-on 4Kids ownership, yet you’d think they’d want to make their mark quick.

LyokoLover: Low-key glad Code Lyoko and Xiaolin Showdown are sticking around. They’ve got that unique appeal that isn’t easy to replace. But curious how long till that changes with this new “Super Duper Late Winter Lineup.” If they’re ushering out TTG and Scooby, who’s next?

Animanga4Life: Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya coming to the block brings back fond Saturday morning memories! Although, I do get why some are skeptical; a lot of these shows have seen multiple reruns over the years.

WebWader: I keep checking the website hoping it’s been updated… No dice. The weird blend of old and new branding isn’t helping anyone. At least update the footer to show 4Kids is steering the ship now. How hard can it be?

ComicStripKid: The lineup change feels like a balance between targeting the parents who grew up with these shows and trying to appeal to the new gen of cartoon fans. GoGoRiki’s charm and simplicity could be their ticket into the latter’s hearts. I see a mascot in the making.

ToonTalker91: Not thrilled about the slow pace here. It’s like we’re stuck in Kids WB limbo. I miss the days when a rebrand meant a fresh start, not this lingering goodbye. Curious how Gloopy and Glitter will fare with the rest of the changes looming… Will they be the last ones standing?

Admin_4KidsRevamp: Please bear with us during this transition. We’re working hard to bring a fresh and exciting lineup while honoring the legacy of what came before. Believe us, it’ll be worth the wait! Stay tuned for more updates and enjoy the shows in the meantime.

Thread Title: CW4Kids Mid-Feb Lineup is Live! Balance of Old and New + Website Updates 🎮📺

DigitalToonFan: The balance has been struck, folks! Five 4Kids classics—Pokémon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby, and GoGoRiki—and five Kids WB staples—Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter, and Code Lyoko. It’s a mix of eras in one block!

ToonMasterJay: Checked out the CW4Kids website, they finally ditched the old footer. It’s official, this ship is sailing under the 4Kids flag now. Nice to see they’re stepping up their game with accounts and points, plus some games to boot!

Animanga4Life: 4Kids moving in with accounts and points? Sounds like they’re setting up a cool rewards system. And that might just get more kids invested in the website beyond streaming shows—a savvy move.

GoGoFan223: GoGoRiki getting prime time with the big 4Kids dogs is great news. Its cute factor is off the charts. Could be the one to round out the new vibe CW4Kids is going for if they play their cards right.

SonicXforever: Glad to see Sonic racing into the lineup. It’s about time he got back into the limelight. Now to see how he fares among the newer offerings. Talk about a speed battle!

PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon getting its rightful place has me all fired up! But it’s kinda odd to still see show pages for the ousted shows on the website. Anyone else notice that? Hopefully, they’ll clear that up soon.

LyokoLover: The fact that Code Lyoko is sticking around amidst all the changes shows its resilience. Maybe 4Kids recognizes the gold they have with some of these Kids WB shows. The perfect yin to their yang.

ComicStripKid: Well, can’t say 4Kids isn’t taking a balanced approach to this transition. Keeping half the lineup from Kids WB seems like a strategic way to ensure they don’t lose the existing audience while they woo new viewers with nostalgia and updated features.

WebWader: The website is getting there, slowly but surely. With account functionality and games, it looks like 4Kids is channeling some vintage interactivity magic. Here’s to mission: engage the digitally-savvy generation!

ToonTalker91: Seeing “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment” at the bottom of the website gives me mixed emotions—it’s good to see they’re updating stuff, but the nostalgia for Kids WB is real. Any bets on how long Gloopy and Glitter can hold out?

Admin_4KidsRevamp: Thanks for sticking with us through the changes! We’re excited about the new lineup and website features, and this is just the beginning. As for the site, we’re rolling out updates over the next few weeks to ensure the best experience for all our visitors.

Thread Title: CW4Kids New Digital Look & Lineup Shuffle – Mid-April Madness Incoming! 💥📺

ToonMasterJay: Mid-April’s gonna hit us with a serious 1-2 punch, folks! We’re diving into a digital online video style aesthetic, making the “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” slogan legit. Plus, line-up’s getting shaken up again—big time!

DigitalToonFan: Heard the scoop that Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, and Ultimate Spider Man are waving goodbye. But we’re keeping the virtual adventures of Code Lyoko and the quirky “Gloopy and Glitter”—two survivors of the cull.

Animanga4Life: For the manga/anime fans, Pokémon Horizons: The Series is swooping in to replace the original Pokémon series! Exciting to see some new journeys and battles. Gotta love the continuous evolution of the Pokémon franchise on the CW4Kids.

GoGoFan223: And what about that triple threat joining the fray? Chaotic, TMNT: Back to the Sewer, and Viva Piñata are about to spice things up! Feels like 4Kids is tossing in as many flavors as they can to see what sticks.

SonicXforever: Greatest thing about CW4Kids right now? They’re not afraid to mix it up. The digital look update has me hyped—it’s like the block is leveling up. Hopefully, it adds a fresh vibe that resonates with the digital generation.

PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon Horizons: The Series will def pull in the crowd looking for that cutting-edge anime action. Pokémon always knows how to keep things fresh.

LyokoLover: Sad to see some old friends go, but Code Lyoko holding strong gives me hope. It’s like our own little slice of stability in this whirlwind of changes.

ComicStripKid: With the digital online style coming, CW4Kids is clearly gunning for a certain look and feel. Let’s just cross our fingers it blends seamlessly with the cartoon essence we all tune in for.

WebWader: Do you think bringing in Chaotic, TMNT, and Viva Piñata is going too far back into the vault? I’m all for nostalgia, but I hope they still invest in newer properties or original content. Balance is key.
