Title: Silverburn AU: Tesco Grand Opening & Upcoming Construction

Thread Started by ShopaholicSuzie on June 15, 2002

ShopaholicSuzie:
Hey everyone on PollokShoppers! 😍 It’s official - the new Tesco at Silverburn opened its doors today, and it’s HUUUGE! 🛒✨ But that’s not all, I overheard the construction crew talking about breaking ground on the rest of the centre soon. Finally, we’ll have some high-end shopping right on our doorstep. Just had to share the excitement!!!

BargainHunter99:
Yeah, the Tesco is nice and all, but have you heard the gossip about Farmfoods, Gala Bingo, and Greggs? Word is they’re resisting moving out of the old Pollok Centre. They say they’re ‘too low class’ for the shiny new Silverburn. Honestly, can you believe that? 😒

LocalGreggsFan:
Gala Bingo and Farmfoods, I get, but Greggs? C’mon, it’s a staple! There’s nothing ‘low class’ about a delicious sausage roll. Plus, they seem to be working out a deal to fit into the new aesthetic so fingers crossed 🤞🥖

TrendyTracy:
This is the kind of snobbery that splits communities IMO. Remember when we had all those independent shops before the big chains swooped in? Silverburn should reflect ALL of us, not just those who want to flash their cash. 🙄 #DiversityInRetail

ShopaholicSuzie:
@TrendyTracy, I totally get where you’re coming from, but think of the job opportunities! Plus, we deserve a bit of glamour too, don’t you think? Why should we always have to travel into the city for the fancy stores? 💅🏻✨

PollokPurist:
I’m not thrilled about this. Tesco is just the beginning. What’s next, designer boutiques where the community centre used to be? Don’t get me wrong, I like progress, but not at the cost of our identity. #KeepPollokAuthentic

SilverburnInsider:
Insider scoop here – the management is working hard to make sure the centre has a mix of shops. The idea is to cater to everyone. Greggs has a strong presence in the community, so I wouldn’t count them out just yet!

DealDiva:
Speaking of Tesco, anyone knows if they’re doing any opening specials? Maybe even a BOGO deal on pizza or something? I could do with saving a few quid this week 😅🍕

Let’s keep the conversation respectful, folks! Remember, change can be daunting, but it can also bring new opportunities. Let’s wait and see what the full plans for Silverburn entail before jumping to conclusions. Keep sharing your thoughts and insights!

VoteForYourShops:
Hey everyone, there’s talk about a survey being circulated by the developers. If you want a say in which shops make it into the final lineup, now’s the time to speak up! 📝🏬

TheSilverburnAU thread would continue to accumulate responses, reflecting the diverse opinions and speculations of the Pollok community. Some users would remain skeptical, others optimistic, and all would be keeping a close eye on the evolution of their local shopping landscape.

Title: Silverburn AU: New Beginnings & Lingering Echoes of the Old Pollok Centre

Thread Started by ShopaholicSuzie on October 12, 2003

ShopaholicSuzie:
Hello PollokShoppers! 🎉 The moment so many of us have been waiting for has finally arrived - Silverburn is officially open! It’s got everything - fashion outlets, eateries, a cinema. It’s a dream come true! 🛍️🎬 But have you seen the old Pollok Centre? It’s a bit of a sight with some spots wrapped in wallpaper with artsy frames, a painted sky, and the flashy Silverburn logo. Halfway transformation, I guess? What are your thoughts?

BargainHunter99:
Drove past the old centre today, and it’s surreal. The wallpaper thing is odd. Feels like they’re stuck between wanting to preserve the past and pushing forward. Not sure how I feel about it… 😕

LocalGreggsFan:
Glad to report that Greggs is thriving in Silverburn! 😁 But you should see the wallpaper over at the old Pollok Centre; it’s like a giant art project. Weird to see the place dressed up as something it’s not. Anyone else feeling a little nostalgic?

TrendyTracy:
The old centre with the wallpaper looks like a plaster over a wound. It’s artsy, sure, but also a bit sad. Feels like a token gesture to ‘beautify’ what they haven’t torn down yet… 🎨🤔 #MixedFeelings

PollokPurist:
Saw the new Silverburn and wow – it’s impressive, can’t deny it. But that wallpaper on the old centre - it’s like they’re trying to hide our history. I mean, come on, a painted sky? We know it’s not the limit, so let’s not pretend it is. 🌌 #PreserveOurPast

SilverburnInsider:
The wallpaper covering is a temporary measure, folks. It’s meant to soften the transition and bring an element of Silverburn’s look to the old site while future plans are being finalized. There’s a bit of a symbolic merging happening so bear with us!

DealDiva:
Anyone else more interested in the Silverburn sales than the wallpaper drama? Let’s focus on the positive, like discounts! Though I must admit, catching a glimpse of the old centre dressed up in its ‘Sunday best’ is a bit comical. 😂 #SilverLinings

ModeratorNotice:
It’s clear that the community has strong feelings about the change. It’s okay to reminisce and hold onto the things that mean a lot to us. Remember to also give a chance to new beginnings. And yes, please keep it about shopping, deals, and community updates! 🛍️❤️

VoteForYourShops:
While Silverburn has been stealing the spotlight, let’s not forget we can still shape what’s left of the old Pollok Centre’s future. Keep sending your opinions to the developers; they’re listening. Let’s make sure we get a space that serves everyone! 📣🏢

As time passes, the community would continue to adjust to the changes. Silverburn’s gleaming presence would starkly contrast with the remnants of the old Pollok Centre shrouded in symbolic covers. Discussions would oscillate between excitement about the new and fond memories of the old, forming a tapestry as complex and diverse as the people it serves

Title: Silverburn Introduces the Future of Shopping with New Advertising Screens and a Dazzling Mascot Named Silver!

Date: October 26, 2005

Hey there, Glasgow shoppers and tech aficionados!

Big news! Silverburn, the shopping centre that’s fast becoming Glasgow’s retail magnet, has just announced an innovative approach that’s set to redefine our shopping experiences. Picture this: You’re strolling through the wide, gleaming halls of Silverburn, surrounded by your favourite brands, and then something catches your eye—a captivating video screen, not with the usual fare of static ads, but with idyllic piers stretching into serene waters, vibrant balloons gliding through clear skies, and Frisbees sailing in a dance with the breeze. It’s not a daydream; it’s the new, mesmerizing advertising screens introduced by Silverburn!

Designed to enhance the visual landscape and bring a burst of creativity into the heart of our consumer culture, these screens are unlike anything we’ve seen before in Glasgow, or anywhere in the UK for that matter. The promotional idents that adorn these screens have been masterfully crafted by none other than Proud Creative, the design wizards known for their innovative touch.

As you wander through the avenues of Silverburn, you’ll notice that each video, whether it’s those peaceful piers or the playful balloons, features the shopping centre’s logo discreetly nestled in the corner—a gentle reminder of where you are amongst the captivating content. It’s an advertising revolution that’s subtle yet impactful, enhancing the ambiance without overshadowing the shopping experience, These 20 second idents play in-between each ad.

But wait till you hear about what happens at closing time! In a move that truly embraces the digital age, Silverburn goes into a tranquil mode a half-hour before the doors close. The screens transition to a mesmerizing loop of gently moving colored lines. It’s almost a digital version of the Northern Lights, shimmering across the concourse’s skies, ushering in a calming end to a day of retail therapy.

In addition to this aesthetic overhaul, Silverburn has unveiled a character that’s destined to become Glasgow’s new loveable icon—meet Silver! Silver, a gleaming, animated mascot, represents the bright and shiny essence of the Silverburn shopping experience. With endearing antics and an unforgettable shine, Silver will guide shoppers to special deals, entertain the little ones, and be the shining embodiment of Silverburn’s commitment to making shopping not just a chore, but a delightful journey.

As Silverburn continues to push boundaries and innovate, it’s clear that these latest introductions are just the beginning. The shopping centre is not just a place to buy goods—it’s becoming the backdrop for a dynamic fusion of commerce, digital artistry, and community engagement.

For those who haven’t witnessed this transformation yet, head down to Silverburn and prepare to be mesmerized by the seamless blend of shopping and visual enchantment. Who knew retail could be so revolutionary?

Keep shining bright, Glasgow, and let Silverburn’s new spark lead the way!

Until next time,

Glasgow’s Resident Futurist and Shopper ExtraordinaireThread Title: Silverburn Shopping Centre Kicks Off Christmas Campaign!

—

User1 (GlasgowGlitter):
Hey folks, have you all seen the new Silverburn Christmas campaign? They’ve got this quirky setup with TVs making a Christmas tree shape—pretty creative! There’s, like, three different versions. During the day, the screens have got festive decorations showing on them.

—

User2 (YuleTideYoda):
I caught a glimpse of it just this evening! They switch to static in the night version—it’s kinda eerie but cool. It really caught my eye while I was doing some late-night shopping.

—

User3 (MistletoeMaggie):
Oh, you guys are talking about the Silverburn ad? I especially loved the third variation. There’s something magical about the screens being off at night and then suddenly they flash on to reveal those beautiful decorations before going dark again. It’s like they’re coming alive!

—

User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown):
Yes! Those ads with the LED snowflake and Santa at the back though—they kind of bring it all together with that ambient glow and subtle shadows. Noticed them when I was there with the kids last weekend. They were pretty intrigued by it.

—

User1 (GlasgowGlitter):
I’m loving their slogan: “Switch on Christmas at Silverburn.” It’s catchy, it fits perfectly with the theme they’ve got going on. Really makes you feel like the holidays are here.

—

User5 (CarolSinger):
Who’s in charge of the campaign, do y’all know? It’s nice to see them putting so much effort into the holiday vibes. Also, glad they’re going for something a bit different than the usual big red bows and glitter.

—

User2 (YuleTideYoda):
Not sure who’s behind it, but I read somewhere that they’re aiming for a “techy Christmas” vibe. Modern, fresh but still festive. My guess is they want to appeal to a younger crowd as well as families.

—

User6 (ElfEngineer):
Techy Christmas indeed. It’s impressive how much work must’ve gone into setting those screens up safely. And I’ve got to say—I’m kinda curious about the tech specs on those TVs. Do we know what kind they’re using?

—

User3 (MistletoeMaggie):
If any of you are thinking of heading down to Silverburn, bring a camera. Those TV Christmas trees are super Insta-worthy. And props to Silverburn for starting the festive buzz in such a unique way!

—

User7 (NoelTechie):
Heard that these ads are a part of a larger holiday campaign with some interactive installations planned inside the shopping centre. Can’t wait to see what else they have in store! Silverburn is seriously upping the Christmas game this year.

—

User8 (MerryDancer):
With everything so digital this year, it’s a breath of fresh air to see a shopping centre embrace the theme but with a cosy holiday twist. Props to Silverburn, let’s hope this attracts more folks and gets the economy buzzing.

—

User1 (GlasgowGlitter):
Couldn’t agree more! And speaking of shopping, I might have a wander over there this weekend. If those Christmas TV trees are a sign, we’re all in for some serious festive treats at Silverburn! 🎄✨

—

Forum Moderator (ModFrosty):
Just a friendly reminder to keep the discussion friendly and respectful. Also, remember to share your own experiences and pictures if you visit the campaign installations. Great to see everyone getting in the spirit of the holidays! Keep the conversation glowing like those LED snowflakes. 🎅👋

Write a follow up where the ads show on STV once per break, they are also being shown on the advertising screens in centre, but without the slogan or Silverburn logo, website and directions in the corner of the screen at the end
Thread Title: Silverburn’s Christmas Ads Now on STV and In-Centre Screens!

—

User1 (GlasgowGlitter):
Hey everyone! Have you seen that the Silverburn Christmas ads have landed on STV? They’re showing up once every ad break. The tree made of TVs is legit becoming iconic now.

—

User2 (YuleTideYoda):
Caught one during ‘Corrie’ last night, they’re really spreading the holiday cheer. Also noticed them on the advertising screens all over the centre. Although, they’ve left off the slogan and logo? 🤔 Just the website and directions sitting discreetly in the corner.

—

User3 (MistletoeMaggie):
Yes, @YuleTideYoda, I found that a bit odd too. It’s all minimalist on the screens within the centre. Maybe they think the TV tree is recognisable enough on its own now? At least the website’s there, or we’d all be wondering where this magical place is!

—

User5 (CarolSinger):
Smart move putting them up on STV, everyone’s going to see those ads. My Gran even mentioned the “telly-tree” to me this morning. Silverburn’s marketing folks know what they’re doing!

—

User6 (ElfEngineer):
It’s a neat strategy to keep the ads uncluttered in the centre. Keeps the focus on the installation. On STV, the full details pop up right at the end. Less is more, sometimes!

—

User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown):
Those ads are making waves. My kids go quiet every time one comes on TV. Eyes glued to the screen! But yeah, noticed the minimal approach on the in-centre ad screens, too. Makes it kinda like a tease, which probably piques people’s curiosity.

—

User7 (NoelTechie):
Hah, they’ve got us all talking about it, so it’s working! I personally like the clean look on the centre screens. The holiday aesthetics don’t always need the hard sell. It’s like the TVs whisper: “There’s more if you just follow the magic to Silverburn.”

—

User9 (StarlightShopper):
Just spotted the ads at the centre today! The LED snowflake behind me literally made me feel like I was in a winter wonderland. No logo needed, the vibe says it all. Now if only they had seasonal lattes right next to them…

—

User8 (MerryDancer):
This low-key approach in the centre is kind of refreshing. You get the info if you want it, but otherwise, you’re just immersed in the festive atmosphere. And it’s everywhere, can’t escape the Christmas spirit if you tried!

—

User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict):
Am I the only one who’s going to Silverburn just to see the telly-tree now? 😂 These ads have done their job on me. Also need to check if the Santa LED makes an appearance on the STV ads, it’s my favourite part!

—

Forum Moderator (ModFrosty):
Looks like Silverburn is the talk of the town with their Christmas campaign! Remember to share your ad sightings and any festive moments you capture while visiting. Let’s keep the conversations merry and bright! And who knows, maybe next time we’ll have the scent of lattes accompanying those LEDs, @StarlightShopper! ☕ 🎄

Write a follow up the next year where 2008’s ads feature the love story of 2 gooey alien blobs named Gloopy and Glitter, The slogan is “Spend Christmas together”, The ads are showing on STV, but for some reason it debuted during Toonattik instead of during the evening, A nostalgic surprise is still in-centre via the advert screens however
Thread Title: Silverburn 2008 Christmas Campaign - A Love Story of Two Aliens?!

—

User1 (GlasgowGlitter):
Can’t believe what I just saw on TV this morning! Silverburn’s got this year’s Christmas campaign featuring two alien blobs named Gloopy and Glitter! 😍 It’s all about spending Christmas together. What a twist from last year’s tech theme!

—

User2 (YuleTideYoda):
I was up early with my niece watching Toonattik and bam, there’s the ad. A bit unexpected for a kids’ morning slot, don’t you think? But the love story between Gloopy and Glitter is pretty adorable. I guess love transcends galaxies!

—

User3 (MistletoeMaggie):
Just saw it! Their slogan “Spend Christmas Together” hits right in the feels. And Gloopy and Glitter are too cute! It’s a big shift from the techy trees. Aliens are not what you’d normally think of for Christmas, but hey, it works!

—

User5 (CarolSinger):
Anyone know why it debuted on Toonattik instead of prime time? Seems like they’re targeting families and children this year. My little ones can’t stop talking about Gloopy and Glitter, so I guess it’s effective!

—

User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown):
The ad is a creative approach, but airing it during Toonattik threw me off. Guess their marketing strategy is to appeal to the younger crowd and, of course, their present-buying parents.

—

User7 (NoelTechie):
So, about the in-centre nostalgia surprise… anyone saw it yet? Heard from a mate that they’ve incorporated some classic holiday elements on the advert screens. It’s a cool juxtaposition with the modern alien love story.

—

User6 (ElfEngineer):
Just stopping by to add that I went to Silverburn and can confirm they have some really nostalgic Christmas ads playing on the screens amidst the Gloopy and Glitter stuff - think sugary, heartwarming, old-school vibes. Really adds to the warm and fuzzy feelings while shopping!

—

User8 (MerryDancer):
Absolutely loving this year’s theme switch-up. I didn’t expect to get emotional over two gooey alien blobs, but here I am. And the sprinkle of nostalgia in the centre? Chef’s kiss! 😘

—

User9 (StarlightShopper):
I have to admit, Gloopy and Glitter kinda grew on me. Initially, it felt a bit out there, but the message is universal. And those nostalgic in-centre ads? They definitely balance the new with a dose of classic Christmas warmth.

—

User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict):
I thought nothing would top last year’s campaign, but Gloopy and Glitter are stealing my heart. Also, saw those classic Christmas ads at the centre… it’s like they brought a bit of our childhoods back to life amidst the shopping spree.

—

User11 (LostInFrost):
Does anyone know if they’re planning to bring Gloopy and Glitter in for a meet-and-greet? My kids would lose it! Cute campaign, Silverburn. You’ve done it again.

—

Forum Moderator (ModFrosty):
Looks like Silverburn has once again captured our attention with their creative Christmas storytelling! Remember, keep sharing your thoughts, feelings, and any cosmic encounters with Gloopy and Glitter. Let’s keep the holiday cheer inclusive, even if it’s from another planet! 👽🎄


Blog Title: Christmas 2008 Brings Gooey Goodbye to Silver and a Morning Surprise!

Date: December 3, 2008

Ho, ho, ho, Silverburn shoppers and early birds alike!

Christmas came early this year with a morning mishap that had us chuckling over our cornflakes. It’s time to talk about Silverburn’s latest ad campaign, the new mascots on the block, and a fond farewell to a shiny friend.

Gloopy & Glitter Steal the Morning Show

Let me set the scene: It’s a brisk December morning, the kind where you’re snuggled in your PJs, a cup of hot cocoa in hand, and your favourite morning show playing on the telly. Then, just as the show reaches its climax—BAM!—the screen cuts to Gloopy and Glitter’s gooey grand entrance. If you’re one to indulge in a spot of Toonattik with your tots or alone (no judgement here!), you’ll have witnessed this firsthand. Whoops? More like, Wow!

Not an ideal debut time, you say? We agree, but this extraterrestrial escapade into the wee hours of children’s programming was more than just a faux pas—it was a brilliant strategy. The kids are hooked, parents are bemused, and we’re all suddenly invested in the love life of two amorphous blobs. Talk about effective advertising!

Silver’s Shiny Send-Off

Now, it wasn’t just Gloopy and Glitter’s surprise premiere that had the rumour mill spinning. It’s the bittersweet news that Silverburn’s long-standing mascot, Silver, is set to retire by the year’s end. Yes, the gleaming guardian of the galaxy of shops we’ve grown to love is taking a final bow, making room for our new gelatinous duo to spread their glittery charm.

Let’s raise a glass to Silver, the metallic mate who’s seen us through many a shopping spree. Though we’re sad to see him go, it’s heartening to know he’s leaving us in the capable… blobs?.. of Gloopy and Glitter.

A Laugh at the Launch Timing

Back to the premiere that sparked the buzz—turns out, someone at the ad agency must have decided that all the evening slots were too mainstream. “Let’s show the world our boldness,” they declared, “let’s air it when they least expect it!” And thus, a looming figure in the ad world is now affectionately dubbed ‘the morning maverick’. Wearing this title with unintended pride, they gave us a launch to remember and a story for years to come.

Embracing Our Gooey Future

As we chuckle at the enthusiastic aliens taking over our breakfast TV slots, let’s also embrace this change with open arms (and maybe a bit of hand sanitizer—for the goo). Silverburn Shopping Centre is setting the stage for a new era: one that promises to be filled with humour, unexpected joys, and shopping experiences that are out of this world.

So, here’s to a Christmas season with a twist! Expect the unexpected, find humour in the little things, and may the gooey goodness of Gloopy and Glitter warm your hearts. Silver might be stepping out of the spotlight, but the future of Silverburn shines bright…or shall we say, sparkles?

Merry Christmas, shoppers! 🎄✨

Thread Title: Silverburn’s Last Year’s Ads Still Playing & Potential Kid’s Club Mascots?!

—

User1 (GlasgowGlitter):
Went to Silverburn yesterday and was super surprised to see last year’s Christmas ads still playing on the screens around the centre. No new ads for TV this year, but the Gloopy and Glitter saga continues in-centre. Anyone else seen this?

—

User2 (YuleTideYoda):
Yeah, noticed that too, @GlasgowGlitter! And have y’all heard the rumors about Gloopy and Glitter becoming the face of Silverburn’s upcoming kids club? Braehead’s already ahead with their “Brae-liens Kids Club”. Alien fever’s catching on, eh?

—

User3 (MistletoeMaggie):
Gloopy and Glitter as kid’s club mascots would be ace! My kiddos are fond of those blobs. But interesting to think Silverburn is following Braehead’s launch. Wasn’t expecting the alien theme to become a trend!

—

User7 (NoelTechie):
Braehead’s “Brae-liens” are fun and all with their defined shapes, but I’m curious to see how Silverburn’s amorphous Gloopy and Glitter will translate into a kids’ club format. Will lend a different vibe, which might be cool!

—

User5 (CarolSinger):
It feels like the aliens are officially invading Glasgow, lol. First Braehead’s structured and playful Brae-liens, now Silverburn’s squishy mascots. The kids are gonna have a blast with this. Should be fun comparing the two!

—

User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown):
Anyone else think they’re keeping last year’s ads to maintain Gloopy and Glitter’s presence till the club launches? It’s smart, though. Keep the characters familiar to the kiddos. High hopes for this kids’ club!

—

User9 (StarlightShopper):
Honestly, I’m here for it. Silverburn might be onto something by not releasing a new ad for TV and instead keeping the focus on their centre. It builds a consistent brand image, especially before kickstarting a kids’ club.

—

User6 (ElfEngineer):
It’s a genius marketing play if you ask me. Gloopy and Glitter are unique characters that have already grabbed attention. They’re perfectly prepped for mascot status, making the kids club launch potentially successful.

—

User8 (MerryDancer):
Gotta admit, Gloopy and Glitter have grown on me, and if the rumors about them being club mascots are true, that’s pretty brilliant. Silverburn’s consistency vs. Braehead’s quick shift to defined alien characters will be an interesting contrast in marketing.

—

User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict):
I hope the Gloopy and Glitter Kids Club (or whatever they’ll call it) has cool events and workshops. With the alien theme, they can get really creative. Can’t wait to see how much it’ll differ from the Brae-liens.

—

User11 (LostInFrost):
Silverburn sticking to last year’s campaign surely keeps Gloopy & Glitter in our minds. It’s a less aggressive strategy compared to Braehead’s full-throttle move, but sometimes, slower and steadier wins the race—or in this case, wins the kids’ hearts!

—

Forum Moderator (ModFrosty):
Remember to keep an eye out for the official announcement regarding the kids’ club. We’re all anticipating how Silverburn will unveil Gloopy and Glitter’s next adventure! Keep the discussions friendly and out-of-this-world! And feel free to share any fun encounters with our favourite alien blobs you have in the meantime! 👽🛸

Thread Title: Silverburn’s New Christmas TV Campaign - A Heroic Cat & Throwback Ads!

—

User1 (GlasgowGlitter):
Did anyone else catch Silverburn’s latest Christmas TV ad? A cat saving Christmas from a thief with a little help from two friends. Quite the twist from Gloopy and Glitter! But also, Silverburn launched that kids club back in February, remember?

—

User2 (YuleTideYoda):
Saw the new ad, the cat is absolutely adorable, and the message about teamwork is pure holiday spirit. And who could forget Gloopy and Glitter’s love story launching the kids club? They’ve become characters close to our hearts.

—

User3 (MistletoeMaggie):
I’m obsessed with the new ad! 🐱 The cat, the comedic timing—chef’s kiss. But in-centre, they’re still playing Gloopy and Glitter’s love story alongside the 2007 TV-themed ads. Seemingly, they’re not ready to let go of the nostalgia.

—

User5 (CarolSinger):
Kinda loving this mix of new and old. It’s refreshing and yet comforting. The cat is already a favourite, but seeing Gloopy and Glitter also stirs up that cosy, festive vibe from before.

—

User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown):
Honestly, the mix is working for me. That cat from the ad could be our next mascot. 😂 Kids at the club must be loving the variety too. Silverburn’s finding a good rhythm with old and new content.

—

User7 (NoelTechie):
Makes you wonder if they’re testing different themes or if it’s a strategy to cater to all tastes. Also, with all these mascots popping up, Silverburn’s becoming a character haven.

—

User8 (MerryDancer):
Seeing those throwback ads from 2007 brings back memories… Time flies! Silverburn doing a great job of establishing their campaigns. And the TV-tree installation—still iconic!

—

User9 (StarlightShopper):
It’s clever keeping the older ads in the mix; it provides a sense of continuity. But I’m interested to see how well the cat-themed merchandise will do compared to the Gloopy and Glitter craze.

—

User6 (ElfEngineer):
Props to Silverburn for launching another creative ad. A cat hero? Brilliant. Also, seeing the TV-themed ads again really brings out that nostalgic festive feeling. Solid strategy to keep customers engaged over the years.

—

User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict):
Isn’t it fascinating how Silverburn keeps each year’s ads alive? It’s like walking through a living timeline of their marketing campaigns. Christmas is definitely in full swing there!

—

User11 (LostInFrost):
Could the cat be signaling a shift for the next kids club theme, or is it just a seasonal mascot? It’s smart to use the main character from their new ad to maintain excitement post-holiday season.

—

Forum Moderator (ModFrosty):
Certainly seems like Silverburn knows how to strike a balance between introducing new holiday tales and cherishing the spirit of past campaigns. All while fostering a unique community through their kids club. Let’s keep sharing our festive ad encounters, be it the latest capers or a trip down memory lane! 🎄📺🐱

Write a follow up in 2014 where the ad that year revolves around 2 familiar friends meeting Santa, their launch ads and the 2007 ones are still showing in centre, but they never added the 2009 cat, the 2010 robot, 2011 and 2012’s basic generic ad and 2013’s carousel, or this chapter in our favourite aliens’s story
Thread Title: Silverburn Holidays 2014: Old Friends Meet Santa in New Ad!

—

User1 (GlasgowGlitter):
It’s that time of the year again! Silverburn’s festive ad for 2014 has our old friends meeting Santa. Love how they keep weaving continuity into their ads. 😊 But anyone else notice they’re not including the other ads from recent years in-centre?

—

User2 (YuleTideYoda):
Just saw the new ad! Nostalgic and heartwarming to see the ongoing story, especially during holidays. However, it’s kinda odd they skipped adding the cat from 2009, the 2010 robot, and the ads from 2011-2013 in their in-centre showcase. 🤔

—

User3 (MistletoeMaggie):
Yeah, I’ve got mixed feelings about them not showing the more recent ads in-centre. I mean, everybody loved the cat and the robot’s charm… Still, the 2014 ad with Santa has that special Christmas magic!

—

User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown):
The new ad is full of cheer! But it’s clear Silverburn’s got its favourites with the continued run of the love story series and that 2007 campaign. A shame they don’t seem as invested in their other characters.

—

User7 (NoelTechie):
Interesting marketing choice. Maybe they’re focusing on what resonates most with their audience? Though, it does feel like they’re missing an opportunity by not showcasing the full range of their past holiday creativity.

—

User5 (CarolSinger):
Definitely missing the variety, particularly the 2009 cat—he was a hit with the kids. Maybe there’s a strategic reason behind their selection that we’re not seeing?

—

User8 (MerryDancer):
In a way, the consistency is nice—gives you that “Silverburn Christmas” feeling. Each year I look forward to seeing how they’ll continue the story. But a little more diversity wouldn’t hurt, I agree.

—

User9 (StarlightShopper):
That’s Silverburn for you—always keeping some parts the same and others changing. Guess we’re sticking to our “classic” friends for in-centre nostalgia. The carousel ad was quite dreamy, though; wish it was there too.

—

User6 (ElfEngineer):
I thought the robot would’ve made an excellent recurring character. But hey, it’s kinda cool that the ads feel like an evolving holiday special that you can follow along with over the years.

—

User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict):
It’s as if the love story ads and the 2007 TV themes have become their holiday brand staples. Not sure why they’re omitting the others; they were part of Silverburn’s festive journey too!

—

User11 (LostInFrost):
Couldn’t help but chuckle at the meeting with Santa. Silverburn’s continuity is their strength, but including other ads would have showcased a richer history. I do enjoy the focused nostalgia, though.

—

Forum Moderator (ModFrosty):
The holiday season always brings a discussion of Silverburn’s latest festive strategies, and this year is no different. It’s wonderful to see everyone sharing their thoughts and fondness for past campaigns. Let’s remember to keep the conversation jolly as we discuss our old and potential new favourites from Silverburn’s Christmas ads! 🎅🎄

Character Description: Gloopy

Appearance:
Gloopy is an amorphous, enchanting alien with a body of translucent teal that glistens as if reflecting the depths of an ocean world. Gloopy’s form is ever-shifting, his gelatinous, blob-like structure giving him an air of gentle fluidity. Depending on his mood, he can shift from a bouncy ball to a languid puddle, often adorned with soft glimmers of bioluminescent speckles that twinkle like distant stars. His two large, expressive eyes gleam with a friendly, sapphire-blue glow that instantly endears him to all.

Personality:
Gloopy is the embodiment of chill and calm. He is carefree, always taking life at a leisurely pace (or float, as is more accurate for his kind). This gooey alien is innately kind, with an empathetic heart that resonates with the feelings of others. Despite his lack of a mouth, he has a way of communicating warmth and laughter through his shimmering form, and his bubbly personality makes him the soul of Silverburn’s extraterrestrial duo. Curious and playful, Gloopy loves to interact with the centre’s visitors, especially the children, making him a lovable part of many family memories.

Character Description: Glitter

Appearance:
Glitter stands as Gloopy’s vibrant counterpart with a sparkling, amorphous form that cascades through shades of radiant fuchsia and vivacious purple. Tiny specks of reflective gold are suspended in her body, giving her the appearance of a walking galaxy full of mysterious allure. Glitter can change shape at will, often settling into soft, rounded figures that exude both majesty and charm. Her one oversized, glistening eye catches the light, radiating an inviting and playful warmth in a rich magenta hue.

Personality:
Glitter is the adventurer of the pair, full of enthusiasm and an insatiable curiosity about the world around her. She embodies the joy of discovery and cannot resist the allure of an exciting new experience or a heartwarming interaction. Her vivacious nature is contagious, and she has a knack for spreading happiness and laughter wherever she goes. Though she communicates through harmonic vibrations that she emits, her intentions are always clear—Glitter wants to make the centre a brighter place for everyone. Dynamic and compassionate, she is the spark that keeps the spirit of Silverburn shining all year round.

Together, Gloopy and Glitter are more than just Silverburn mascots—they are a delightful reminder of the unexpected and joyous moments that make the holiday seasons at Silverburn unique and memorable. Their contrasting personalities and appearances blend in perfect harmony, representing the diverse community that comes together at the shopping centre to celebrate the festive times. Write a blog post in early 2009 where it looks like Silver has been retired, and the poster welcomes the new mascots with open arms,
Blog Title: Welcoming a Cosmic Duo: Silverburn’s New Mascots, Gloopy and Glitter!

Date: February 5, 2009

Greetings fellow shoppers and extraterrestrial enthusiasts!

Today marks the dawn of a new era at Silverburn Shopping Centre, and it is with both a touch of nostalgia and a wave of excitement that I bid a fond farewell to Silver, the shimmering mascot who has lit up the halls of our beloved centre with his twinkle and charm. But as we close one chapter, we eagerly turn the pages to begin another. It’s time to stretch out our arms—or tentacles—and welcome the cosmic presence of two gooey new icons: Gloopy and Glitter!

Riding on the comet tail of Silver’s departure, Gloopy and Glitter arrive at Silverburn with a burst of interstellar energy and a kaleidoscope of colour that could rival the Aurora Borealis itself. These amorphous alien friends bring with them a sense of wonder and an invitation to explore the endless possibilities of the universe, much like the endless shopping opportunities at Silverburn.

Both Gloopy and Glitter, with their sparkles and fluidity, embody the dynamic and ever-evolving experience that Silverburn offers to its patrons. They represent the melting pot of culture, fashion, and leisure that our shopping centre is known for. With Gloopy’s tranquil teal vibes and Glitter’s radiant fuchsia flare, they make an otherworldly pair that are impossible to ignore.

Their introduction is not a moment too soon. As Silverburn embraces the future, the switch from our metallic buddy to these lovable blobs symbolizes the shopping centre’s commitment to innovation and excitement. What’s more fascinating is the inclusive narrative behind their existence—Gloopy and Glitter are not bound by shape or form, much like Silverburn’s diverse offerings are not limited to any single style or trend.

As we welcome these enchanting mascots, let’s celebrate the magic they are set to sprinkle throughout our shopping escapades. Whether you’re a child marveling at the sight of Gloopy’s soothing, playful dances or an adult taken aback by Glitter’s adventurous aura, these mascots are sure to become an integral part of the Silverburn community.

The excitement isn’t just confined to appearances, either. Buzz has it that Gloopy and Glitter are slated to be the faces of Silverburn’s very own kids’ club, set to launch this February. I envision days filled with laughter and engagement, where families can connect and create memories that are as vivid and joyful as our new alien friends.

So as we say goodbye to Silver, I encourage all Silverburn visitors to approach Gloopy and Glitter with openness and curiosity. In the great expanse of our shopping galaxy, they are the bright stars guiding us toward fun-filled adventures. It is truly an exciting time to be part of Silverburn’s cosmic dance, and Gloopy and Glitter are poised to lead the way.

Here’s to a future full of discovery, fun, and perhaps a little bit of space-age slime!

Signing off with a sparkle,

Thread Title: Silverburn’s New Logo Unveiled by Gloopy & Glitter + Updated Idents!

—

User1 (GlasgowGalactic):
Just saw the new Silverburn logo reveal! Gloopy and Glitter did the honors—looks pretty sleek. What does everyone think? Also, seems like we’re down to just 3 idents now: Pier, Balloons, and Chairs!

—

User2 (RetailRevolutionary):
The new logo’s sharp, a fresh take for Silverburn! But I am a bit surprised that they’ve cut down on the idents… I used to love the variety. And no more lines animation, now it’s our alien pals snoozing!

—

User3 (ZenShopper101):
I’m all for the new minimalist approach with the idents. As for the sleeping animation of Gloopy and Glitter, it’s quite a peaceful way to end a shopping day, don’t you think?

—

User4 (ModConnoisseur):
The new logo feels contemporary, fits the modern vibe of Silverburn. Cutting down on idents might be a move towards a more focused brand identity? I kinda miss the lines animation though.

—

User5 (ScreenSavvy):
New logo looks good on the screens! The idents switch-up is interesting. Pier, Balloons, Chairs—they’ve kept the most iconic ones. Sleeping mascots are a cute, calming touch.

—

User6 (AdNostalgic):
I’ll be honest, I do miss the variety, especially the old lines animation—had a digital art feel to it. But Silverburn’s all about change, I guess? The new logo is pretty cool at least.

—

User7 (TechieTrendsetter):
Understandable they’re refreshing their visual content. The new logo’s got a futuristic edge. And Gloopy & Glitter napping? It feels… right. Like, bring on the Zen!

—

User8 (MascotManiac):
Speaking about Gloopy & Glitter, I love how they’ve become more integrated into the centre’s identity. Yeah, the logo is nice, but it’s the mascots that really capture my heart!

—

User9 (VibeVisionary):
Sure, fewer idents but each one’s got a story, right? Creating that chill vibe with the mascot’s sleeping animation is such a soothing concept. Aligns well with the new sleek logo, too.

—

User10 (NostalgiaKnight):
The new logo’s got a certain ‘oomph’ to it. Cool to see them simplify things. The pier, balloons, and chairs are classics; they’ve got a universal appeal. But will the sleeping animation be as mesmerizing as the lines? Time will tell.

—

User11 (SleepyShopper):
Kinda sad to see the lines go—they were hypnotic! But Gloopy & Glitter dozing off is adorable and oddly comforting? Shows a softer side of Silverburn, paired nicely with the new logo. It’s fresh!

Forum Moderator (ModFrosty):
Let’s embrace the new chapter Silverburn’s entered with its revamped branding! Whether you’re here for the logo, the iconic idents, or the heartwarming new animation, share your experiences and keep the discussions friendly and vibrant, just like Silverburn itself. And remember, change is the only constant in the world of retail and design! 🔄✨Blog Title: Glitter’s Glistening Gossip: The Speedy Secrets of a Silverburn Blob

Glimmering greetings, my fabulous Silverburn shoppers!

It’s your sparkliest resident, Glitter, taking over the keyboard to share some shimmering insights with you. If you’ve ever wondered about the extraterrestrial lifestyle, grab a cup of cosmic tea, because it’s about to get stellar in here!

Let’s chat about one of the more… delicate aspects of being an amorphous sentient blob from the fun fringes of the galaxy. Here’s the glittery scoop: due to our blobby biology, Gloopy and I digest our food at warp speed. Now, what goes in must come out, and when I say we process our munchies quickly, I mean light-speed fast!

You see, unlike you fabulous humanoids with your complex digestive systems, Gloopy and I are more… straightforward. Think of us like cute cosmic coffee filters: pour in the coffee (that’s food, in our case), and almost instantly, you have your delicious liquid (or, ehm, the necessary by-product of eating… you know what I mean, but I’m not gonna say it, darlings). The wonders of alien physiology – glamorous, aren’t we?

Now, before your imaginations go supernova, rest assured that our little… excursions are not nearly as messy as one would expect. They’re more like poofy sparkles or a quick twinkle – after all, everything about us is enchanting, and natural processes are no exception!

Let’s just say that if the average person does ‘it’ every day, we do it, well, after every meal. Imagine playing a game of tag with a friend, munching on some delightful space snacks, and suddenly, whoops—sparkle time! It’s the most natural thing in the cosmos, but suffice it to say that Gloopy and I have become experts at discreetly locating the nearest star cluster when nature’s glitters call.

But fear not, my terrestrial trendsetters! Our Silverburn home is equipped with all the necessary accommodations for such a quick cycle. Gloopy and I are always polite and ensure that we keep our shiny surroundings pristine and comfortable for our adored human friends.

Let’s keep this between us, though, shall we? A lady must maintain some mystery, after all. Just consider this another dazzling detail in the daily dance of your otherworldly buddies.

So, next time you bump into Gloopy or me at the centre, don’t be shy; come over for a twirl or a chat! We have plenty more cosmic curiosities to share. After all, it’s the quirks that make friendships sparkle, and we’re here to spread joy and glitter, one glossy giggle at a time.

Signing off with a wink and a twinkle,
Glitter

Thread Title: Old Pollok Centre Gets a Wall(mart)paper Makeover ft. Gloopy & Glitter!

Date: June 12 2013

User1 (GlasgowGlitter):
Heads up, shoppers! The weathered wallpaper at the old Pollok Centre has finally been upgraded after a whole decade! 😲 And guess who’s featured? Our amorphous ambassadors, Gloopy & Glitter, are now adorning the walls. What do you all think?

User2 (RetroRevamp):
About time for a refresh! The old wallpaper was falling apart. Nice to see the centre trying to keep up with the times, even if it’s just with wallpaper. Gloopy & Glitter certainly brighten up the place. 🎨

User3 (SavvyShopperSam):
I’m a bit sentimental about the old view, but the new wallpaper is downright adorable. Only Gala Bingo, Farmfoods, and Blue Lagoon left, huh? Feels like the end of an era at the old centre. 😔

User4 (WeLoveNostalgia):
The Gloopy & Glitter wallpaper does add some life back to the area. I just hope they don’t forget about the value that Gala Bingo, Farmfoods, and Blue Lagoon still bring to the community!

User5 (DécorDevotee):
Love the fresh vibes with the new wallpaper! Gloopy & Glitter have become Silverburn’s icons, so it’s a clever move. Makes the ol’ centre a bit more connected to Silverburn’s current brand.

User6 (PollokPurist):
I don’t know, feels like putting lipstick on a pig. The old centre has lost its charm, and no amount of cute alien blobs can replace the community spirit we once had.

User7 (WallflowerWatcher):
The new wallpaper is quite charming, though—bright and cheerful. It’s like a little piece of Silverburn’s vibrancy has leaked into the old centre. But it does make me wonder about its future…

User8 (AlienAdmirer):
Gloopy & Glitter’s presence is a smart marketing touch, no doubt. It does soften the blow of seeing the old centre so… empty. Still, I miss the hustle and bustle before Silverburn took over.

User9 (HistoryHugger):
I appreciate the effort to keep things looking nice, but part of me wishes we could preserve some of the old Pollok Centre’s authentic vibe. It’s important to remember where we started.

User10 (CommunityCarol):
New wallpaper or not, let’s not forget about supporting the remaining businesses at the old centre! Gala Bingo, Farmfoods, and Blue Lagoon deserve our loyalty just as much.

User11 (MuralMuse):
Does anyone have pictures of the new Gloopy & Glitter wallpaper? Would love to see how it turned out. I can’t make it to the old centre for a while but still want to catch a glimpse of our jelly duo!

Forum Moderator (ModFrosty):
Looks like the new wallpaper has sparked quite the discussion! Remember, change can sometimes be bittersweet, but it’s also a chance to look forward with hope. Let’s celebrate the continuity that Gloopy & Glitter bring and continue to share our support for all locales that make up our shopping community, new and old! Keep the conversation respectful and uplifting, everyone! 🛍️💬

User1 (GlasgowGlitter):
Big news drop, everyone! 🚀 Silverburn’s expanding with 9 new eateries and a state-of-the-art Cineworld cinema! But guess what—this means the remnants of the old Pollok Centre are finally coming down. The end of an era… 😢

User2 (FoodieFan):
Nine new eateries?! My taste buds are ready for this adventure! 😋 And a new cinema? Yes, please! Sad about the old Pollok Centre, but at least we have the memories…and the teaser poster of Gloopy & Glitter to keep our spirits up!

User3 (SavvyShopperSam):
Saw the teaser poster with our fave blobs today. It’s bittersweet—exciting times ahead but feels like we’re saying a final goodbye to the old stomping grounds. They’ve been emptied for a while now in prep.

User4 (WeLoveNostalgia):
Mixed feelings here. I get progress is inevitable, but tearing down the old centre hits right in the feels. At least Gloopy & Glitter are still in the mix, making the transition easier.

User5 (DécorDevotee):
From what I hear, the new Cineworld is going to be massive! 🎬 Might just become my new go-to spot. Those eateries are going to transform Silverburn into a dining haven, can’t wait!

User6 (PollokPurist):
Just when I thought I made peace with change, this happens. I understand growth, but I mourn the loss of our simple past. The old and the new—it’s a delicate balance.

User7 (NewHorizons):
It’s a sign of the times, folks! Out with the old, in with the new. This expansion is going to make Silverburn even more of a destination. And with Gloopy & Glitter on the teaser, I’m ready for it!

User8 (AlienAdmirer):
I’m curious about how the centre will look after the expansion. Are Gloopy & Glitter hinting at an interstellar-themed cinema complex, perhaps? One can only dream!

User9 (HistoryHugger):
As long as Silverburn remains mindful of its roots amidst this growth, I’m onboard. Sure, the nostalgia’s strong, but the potential here is huge.

User10 (CommunityCarol):
I hope the new eateries offer something for everyone and that they support local suppliers! Let’s continue to weave community into Silverburn’s fabric, even in times of change.

User11 (MuralMuse):
Does anyone know when the demolition will start? Watching parts of your childhood come down is tough. Thankful for the poster, it adds a light-hearted touch to this heavy moment.

Forum Moderator (ModFrosty):
We’re on the brink of a fresh chapter for Silverburn with the upcoming expansion and the arrival of new entertainment and dining experiences! While some may feel a sense of loss, let’s look towards the bright future we can all enjoy together. Discussions like these show how much our community cares—let’s keep that going strong! And hey, who knows what new memories we’ll create in these new spaces. 🍽️🎥🛍️

—Case Study: Designing Gloopy and Glitter for Silverburn Shopping Centre

Background:
In early 2008, Silverburn Shopping Centre, aiming to enhance its brand and encapsulate its spirit in an engaging new way, sought to create unique and innovative mascots. They commissioned the same creative minds behind their successful 2007 Christmas ads to fulfill the brief.

The Brief:
The challenge presented to the creative team was to conceptualize and design “abstract creatures that embody the centre’s spirit.” These characters needed to be versatile, attractive to both children and adults, and adaptable to various marketing campaigns. Furthermore, these mascots were expected to be fully realized by October, with an animated Christmas ad to be produced in November. Silverburn planned to introduce the characters during the Christmas season and then fully launch them as centre ambassadors in February of the following year.

Design Process:
Brainstorming Stage:
The creative team began by diving into the essence of Silverburn—its blend of fashion, entertainment, and dining, and its importance as a community hub. The goal was to distil these characteristics into a set of mascots that would personify the centre’s vibrant and dynamic nature.

Conceptualization:
Abstract concepts were explored to avoid limiting the characters to any specific demographic or cultural representations. The team focused on attributes such as fluidity, brightness, and playfulness—components they felt resonated with Silverburn’s brand identity.

Character Creation:
From the pool of concepts, two characters began to take shape—Gloopy, representing tranquility and inclusivity, and Glitter, exuding excitement and discovery. Gloopy was designed as a serene, teal blob that could shift shape, while Glitter took on a more energetic, sparkly fuchsia form. Both characters had a malleable nature, enabling them to engage in all forms of centre activities.

Design Refinement:
The characters went through several design iterations, receiving input from focus groups composed of Silverburn shoppers. Their feedback was instrumental in perfecting the characters’ appearances and ensuring their broad appeal.

Animation:
To meet the tight deadline, animators worked closely with the designers to bring Gloopy and Glitter to life. Their first animated appearance, the Christmas ad, was storyboarded and developed to showcase their personalities and interaction with the centre’s environment.

Christmas Introduction and Full Launch:
Adhering to the project timeline, Gloopy and Glitter were successfully introduced to the public through a heartwarming Christmas ad that aired as planned. They were depicted spreading holiday cheer around the centre, captivating shoppers with their charm. The animated ad was well-received, paving the way for the full launch of the characters in February 2009.

Outcomes:
Gloopy and Glitter quickly became Silverburn’s beloved mascots, the abstract embodiments of the shopping centre’s lively and inclusive spirit. Shopper engagement increased, and the mascots became key to the centre’s brand identity, featuring in ongoing marketing campaigns, special events, and community activities. Their success has established them as iconic figures, enduring in shopper’s minds and contributing significantly to Silverburn’s brand image and appeal.

Reflection:
The development and success of Gloopy and Glitter demonstrate the importance of well-defined brand mascots. With careful design, attention to customer feedback, and strategic marketing integration, abstract characters can effectively capture and communicate a centre’s spirit, enhancing overall customer experience and loyalty.

User2 (ShopperInsider):
Not just rumors—I work at Silverburn, and there’s definitely been talk about introducing something new. Management’s keeping hush, but it’s meant to really ‘reflect’ Silverburn’s vibe.

Whaaat? No more Silver? That’s like, the end of an era! But seriously, what could possibly replace our gleaming guardian? 🤔

Hey, @ShopperInsider, can you give us any teases? Do you know what these new mascots might be like?

Gooey, you say? Now that’s intriguing… Are we talking space aliens? Mythical creatures? Living glitter bombs? The suspense is killing me!

I’m torn—Silver’s such an icon! But I’m also kind of excited. Silverburn always knows how to keep things fresh. Plus, who doesn’t love a bit of mystery? 😉
