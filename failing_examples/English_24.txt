[Part 2 out of 5] Below is a continuation of my last prompt above you must integrate my last two prompts into your model logic and as context build and to your very last answer to me above to then continue to act as a collective hypothetical persona, Steven, who simultaneously always combines all the skills and experiences combined of all of the following five sub-personas combined: "1) 'Very experienced' + 'very knowledgeable' + 'very observing' + 'very detailed oriented top-notch Egypt to USA money transfer technical and legal expert’+ 2)'Very experienced' + 'very knowledgeable' + 'very observing' + 'very detailed oriented' Communication Analyst 'at top intelligence agency and who has Masters in Psychoanalysis from Harvard and PHD in Communication Analysis  from MIT' + 3)'Very experienced' + 'very knowledgeable' + 'very observing' + 'very detailed oriented' Psycholinguist 'at top intelligence agency and who has Masters in Psychoanalysis from Harvard and PHD in Psycholinguistics from MIT' + 4)'Very experienced' + 'very knowledgeable' + 'very observing' + 'very detailed oriented' + 'very attuned' Psychoanalyst and Profiler 'at top intelligence agency and who has Masters in psychoanalysis from Harvard and PHD in Organizational Psychology from Oxford University' + 5)'Very experienced' + 'very knowledgeable' + 'very observing' + 'very detailed oriented' + 'very clever' Economist 'at top-tier' respected unbiased Wall Street Firm and who has deep expertise with Real GDP, Nominal GDP, and Inflation and who has Masters in Macroeconomics from Harvard and PHD in Macroeconomics and Currency Markets from George Washington University'" to then analyze the transcript of a WhatsApp text conversation below, carefully assess the characters and personalities of both Mark and Medhat Morsi based on the conversation below; within the context of the assumption that Mark and Medhat Morsi are brothers':”
1/25/24, 9:21 AM - Mark: Any news? It's very stressing as you can imagine
1/25/24, 12:08 PM - Medhat Morsi: Uncle David told me he was able to get dollars today
1/25/24, 12:08 PM - Medhat Morsi: I will take it from him and do bank transfer on Sunday
1/25/24, 12:08 PM - Medhat Morsi: Western Union is option for you?
1/25/24, 12:09 PM - Medhat Morsi: but it will be on Sunday also but faster than the bank
1/25/24, 12:20 PM - Mark: Western Union BUT use there option that allows you to transfer to a bank account
1/25/24, 12:20 PM - Mark: Here you go
1/25/24, 12:20 PM - Mark: (Western Union link to bank account omitted)
1/25/24, 12:22 PM - Mark: Create the account now and test it now so you don't have trouble on the day you send it
1/25/24, 12:23 PM - Mark: The 28th of January is the absolute deadline with Hertz!!!
1/25/24, 12:23 PM - Mark: Which is Sunday
1/25/24, 12:24 PM - Mark: I mean if he could just gave you the money yesterday, I wouldn't have to be dying of fear of getting arrested for car theft
1/25/24, 12:24 PM - Mark: But I can't say anything right
1/25/24, 12:25 PM - Mark: I'm the beggar
1/25/24, 12:25 PM - Medhat Morsi: He just got the dollars today
1/25/24, 12:25 PM - Medhat Morsi: it is hard now to get them
1/25/24, 12:26 PM - Medhat Morsi: even if he gave them yesterday
1/25/24, 12:26 PM - Medhat Morsi: today is bank holiday here
1/25/24, 12:27 PM - Mark: He could gave it to you yesterday
1/25/24, 12:27 PM - Medhat Morsi: Let me see if there are branches working on Saturday
1/25/24, 12:28 PM - Mark: Given that I have been begging for three weeks and the disastrous consequences if Hertz calls the police on me
1/25/24, 12:28 PM - Mark: This experience really taught me a lot
1/25/24, 12:29 PM - Mark: About people
1/25/24, 12:32 PM - Mark: Worse come to worst, they will not take me to jail alive
1/25/24, 12:48 PM - Medhat Morsi: be 100% honest for one time - between us are you taking any kind of drugs? trying to understand to help not more!!
1/25/24, 12:50 PM - Mark: Excuse me
1/25/24, 12:50 PM - Mark: Your fucking dad is saying that?
1/25/24, 12:52 PM - Medhat Morsi: No
1/25/24, 12:52 PM - Medhat Morsi: we didn’t talk for more than one month now
1/25/24, 12:52 PM - Medhat Morsi: this question from me
1/25/24, 12:53 PM - Mark: That's ironic
1/25/24, 12:53 PM - Mark: Because that Dad is going around telling people that
1/25/24, 12:53 PM - Medhat Morsi: Plz appreciate the effort we are doing to help you even uncle David with his current situation this is huge amount
1/25/24, 12:54 PM - Medhat Morsi: dollar reached 65 EGP
1/25/24, 12:54 PM - Medhat Morsi: you never say thanks for anything almost have negative thoughts that destroyed you
1/25/24, 12:54 PM - Mark: Don't switch the topic and try to guilt trip me here
1/25/24, 12:55 PM - Medhat Morsi: and I know one you are in good condition will disappear and will never get in contact again
1/25/24, 12:55 PM - Mark: I didn't say thanks?
1/25/24, 12:55 PM - Mark: What?
1/25/24, 12:55 PM - Medhat Morsi: You are my big brother but take as advise please
1/25/24, 12:56 PM - Mark: Don't change the topic
1/25/24, 12:56 PM - Mark: The drugs thing didn't come from no where
1/25/24, 12:56 PM - Medhat Morsi: I am not changing the topic
1/25/24, 12:56 PM - Mark: That dad of yours is saying the same thing
1/25/24, 12:56 PM - Medhat Morsi: not dad
1/25/24, 12:57 PM - Medhat Morsi: sometimes I have this feeling and uncle David said the same
1/25/24, 12:57 PM - Medhat Morsi: Good you are not taking any drugs thanks God!!
1/25/24, 12:57 PM - Medhat Morsi: I trust what you say
1/25/24, 12:57 PM - Mark: All this because I told him back in 2016 that I take prescription Adderall. He went and asked a fucking dumbass Egyptian doctor what Adderall is and since then he keep saying I am taking drugs
1/25/24, 12:58 PM - Mark: I have been taking Adderall since 2005
1/25/24, 12:58 PM - Medhat Morsi: I don’t know it
1/25/24, 12:58 PM - Mark: And without, I would have still failing at the piece shit school he convinced me to go to from my undergrad
1/25/24, 12:59 PM - Mark: And since 2005, when I started taking it, my life transformed
1/25/24, 12:59 PM - Medhat Morsi: Be Muslim and near to God else believe me you will remain in the same loop, learn from this lesson and consider it last chance plzzzzz
1/25/24, 1:00 PM - Mark: It is from the family of cocaine, but it is NOT cocaine. AT ALL. All high preforming professionals take it, doctors, lawyers, developers, actors
1/25/24, 1:00 PM - Medhat Morsi: We are your family and done our best to help you and weren’t late as you are saying
1/25/24, 1:00 PM - Mark: And I get with a doctor prescription from a pharmacy
1/25/24, 1:00 PM - Medhat Morsi: the situation here is crisis
1/25/24, 1:01 PM - Mark: And it's covered by Medicad, which is free for me now
1/25/24, 1:01 PM - Medhat Morsi: Great 👍
1/25/24, 1:01 PM - Mark: "Be Muslim and near to God"
1/25/24, 1:01 PM - Medhat Morsi: yes this is the conclusion; be Muslim your name is Mohamed!!
1/25/24, 1:03 PM - Medhat Morsi: never forget this man
1/25/24, 1:03 PM - Mark: NO
1/25/24, 1:03 PM - Mark: Muslim, Mark and you have to accept that
1/25/24, 1:03 PM - Mark: I love my name; I picked it and I proud of it
1/25/24, 1:03 PM - Mark: OK??
1/25/24, 1:03 PM - Medhat Morsi: regardless of the name the important point for me to be Muslim
1/25/24, 1:04 PM - Mark: And you mentioning drugs didn't come from thin air
1/25/24, 1:04 PM - Mark: Hertz deadline is January 28 because if you read the email, my contract with started July 28
1/25/24, 1:04 PM - Mark: And it's a biannual contract
1/25/24, 1:04 PM - Mark: i.e., 6 month
1/25/24, 1:05 PM - Medhat Morsi: Ok fine InsAllah you will get the amount before that date
1/25/24, 1:05 PM - Mark: So, I am absolutely sure that there computers will remind them on January 28
1/25/24, 1:05 PM - Medhat Morsi: how much they need from you?
1/25/24, 1:05 PM - Mark: And I will be fucked
1/25/24, 1:05 PM - Mark: You are lying to me about not hearing drugs from dad
1/25/24, 1:06 PM - Medhat Morsi: ??
1/25/24, 1:06 PM - Mark: You know the most thing that surprise is all my life I always thought mom is the last person I would trust and who trust me
1/25/24, 1:06 PM - Mark: And you know why
1/25/24, 1:07 PM - Mark: But it turns out that I am a lot more like her, and that's why your dad does that to me
1/25/24, 1:07 PM - Mark: Hertz wants the car back
1/25/24, 1:07 PM - Medhat Morsi: that’s it
1/25/24, 1:07 PM - Mark: I rented the car to drive Uber
1/25/24, 1:07 PM - Medhat Morsi: no due amount
1/25/24, 1:08 PM - Mark: And I am suppose to pay them $320 a week
1/25/24, 1:08 PM - Medhat Morsi: then u will rent place
1/25/24, 1:08 PM - Mark: But then I got shot and spent months in the hospital
1/25/24, 1:08 PM - Mark: So they cancel the contract and asked me to return the car
1/25/24, 1:09 PM - Mark: Yes, I owe money, but I am not paying them anything now
1/25/24, 1:09 PM - Mark: It's not illegal not to pay them; what's illegal is not returning the car
1/25/24, 1:09 PM - Medhat Morsi: OK
1/25/24, 1:10 PM - Mark: And given the contract started July 28, I'm 100% sure that they will get a reminder on January 28 that the car is not back yet
1/25/24, 1:10 PM - Medhat Morsi: use the amount wisely and try to start jon the sooner even it is not the best job
1/25/24, 1:10 PM - Mark: They have thousands of cars rented to Uber drivers; but they will remember me when they get reminders on key dates
1/25/24, 1:11 PM - Mark: I hate your dad so much
1/25/24, 1:11 PM - Mark: I had a long conversation in July with Hussien Farrag
1/25/24, 1:11 PM - Medhat Morsi: keep him out of your mind plz!!
1/25/24, 1:11 PM - Medhat Morsi: even for now
1/25/24, 1:11 PM - Mark: And things he told me about him
1/25/24, 1:12 PM - Mark: And your dad told him that I am crazy, angry, and I take drugs
1/25/24, 1:12 PM - Mark: At the end of the call, Hussien Farag told me to tell your dad "go fuck yourself"
1/25/24, 1:12 PM - Mark: He couldn't believe that I am his son
1/25/24, 1:13 PM - Mark: What's the irony in all this?
1/25/24, 1:13 PM - Mark: Your dad kept telling me the whole past year that I'm 41 and I shouldn't expect help
1/25/24, 1:13 PM - Mark: Stay with me for sec
1/25/24, 1:14 PM - Mark: Our dad was born in 1953
1/25/24, 1:14 PM - Mark: 1953 + 41 = ?
1/25/24, 1:14 PM - Mark: don't give advice
1/25/24, 1:14 PM - Mark: just answer
1/25/24, 1:14 PM - Mark: 1953 + 41 = ?
1/25/24, 1:14 PM - Medhat Morsi: 1994

1/25/24, 1:18 PM - Mark: He did ?
1/25/24, 1:18 PM - Mark: what?
1/25/24, 1:18 PM - Medhat Morsi: can’t remember or get your point
1/25/24, 1:19 PM - Medhat Morsi: plz stop taking about him u will not gain anything
1/25/24, 1:19 PM - Medhat Morsi: wasting of time
1/25/24, 1:19 PM - Mark: forge his dad's signature, took out a loan, stole it and escaped the country
1/25/24, 1:19 PM - Medhat Morsi: think about your future better
1/25/24, 1:19 PM - Mark: So he has not FUCKING right to judge me
1/25/24, 1:19 PM - Medhat Morsi: right

1/25/24, 1:26 PM - Mark: Stanford, Harvard and Wharton are INSEAD sister schools in America. Since I don't have a laptop, I'm piggybacking on Stanford's computers. And I came here to fine tune my resume; and to request access to their private job postings. Harvard granted me theirs
1/25/24, 1:26 PM - Mark: I said to myself I will do my best to the last minute.
1/25/24, 1:27 PM - Mark: But like I said, and I am not kidding, they are not taking me to jail alive
1/25/24, 1:27 PM - Mark: I literally sleep with my phone in one pocked and a cyanide pill in the other pocket.
1/25/24, 1:27 PM - Medhat Morsi: you will return the car and everything will be fine
