<2레벨로 회귀한 무신 289화>
스페이스 아레나 5라운드.
라운드에서 매칭되는 플레이어들의 운명은, 그 전과 똑같았다.
[이런 종도…….]
“그 소리만 몇 번짼지 지겹군.”
이딴 하급 종도 5라운드에 오냐고, 거대 종족이 말을 끝내기도 전에.
성지한은 손가락에 불을 지폈다.
화르르륵!
그러자 단번에 소각되는 플레이어들.
[이놈!]
[용의 불인가. 이 정도는 견딜 수 있다……!]
물론 5라운드까지 올라온 실력자들이라 그런지, 전 단계의 상대보다는 오래 버티긴 했지만.
“좀 하네?”
성지한의 손가락 끝에, 불이 한 번 더 피어오르자.
거대한 화마가 또다시 경기장을 덮쳤다.
5라운드에 올 때까지, 화신의 잔재를 계속 흡수한 덕분에 8까지 오른 스탯 적.
스탯의 숫자 자체는 얼마 되지 않았지만, 그것이 지닌 화력은 압도적이었다.
-5라운드도 별거 없네.
-ㄴㄴ 일반 인류 플레이어였으면 1라운드에서 광탈할 듯
-성지한 기준에서 생각하면 안 됨 이제 ㅋㅋㅋ
-ㄹㅇ 조인족한테 진 게 이틀 전이야.
매번 1분도 채 되지 않아서 플레이어들을 삭제시킨 성지한을 보고, 이거 가지고 상대를 폄하하면 안 된다고 시청자들이 이야기를 나누고 있을 때.
[5라운드를 최단기간으로 클리어했습니다.]
펑! 펑!
하늘 위에서, 성지한의 라운드 종료를 축하하듯 거대한 폭죽이 끊임없이 터져 나갔다.
그리고.
[특수 업적, ‘스페이스 아레나 – 1관문 정복’을 클리어했습니다.]
[업적 포인트를 2,000,000 얻습니다.]
[스페이스 아레나의 유망주로 주목을 받습니다.]
[종족 ‘인류’가 브론즈 리그에 속해 잠겨 있던, 커뮤니티 기능 일부가 해제됩니다.]
[승급전을 종료하시겠습니까?]
[종료하지 않을 시, 숨겨진 존재가 나타납니다.]
‘커뮤니티 기능?’
이건 나중에 확인해 봐야겠군.
성지한은 메시지를 쭉 읽다가, 승급전을 종료하겠냐는 메시지에 아니오를 눌렀다.
그러자.
[숨겨진 존재 중, 플레이어와 맞는 상대를 매칭합니다…….]
[불의 힘으로 자신을 증명했습니다.]
[‘화신이었던 존재’가 소환됩니다.]
쿠르르르……!
경기장 바닥이 흔들리더니.
중앙의 땅바닥이 융기되며, 경기장을 부수기 시작했다.
펑! 펑!
그리고 여기저기서 치솟는 용암 줄기.
그것은 곧 한데 모이며, 거대한 불의 거인으로 변했다.
[하하! 정말 성공했구나! 이 몸으로, 출전할 수 있게 되다니……!]
“그게 네 본신인가.”
[그렇다. 참으로 잘해 주었다!]
화신의 본신은 자신의 몸을 이리저리 만지더니.
곧 거대한 손바닥을 하늘 위로 향했다.
쿠르르르……!
그러자 거대한 불줄기가 하늘 위로 치솟더니.
사방으로 불꽃이 퍼져 나갔다.
거대한 경기장의 끝, 관중석까지 침범한 불은.
파스스스…….
관중석을 넘지 못하고, 스스로 꺼졌다.
[역시 안 되는군.]
이를 예상했다는 듯, 손을 다시 움켜쥐는 불의 거인.
“이제 알려 주지?”
[아레나의 주인에 대해서 말인가.]
“어.”
[알겠다. 약속은 약속이니까, 지켜야겠지. 다만.]
불의 거인은 양팔을 넓게 뻗었다.
그러자 온몸이 샛노랗게 물들더니, 전신에 불꽃이 피어오르는 거인.
[네 안에 들어가, 이야기를 해 주지!]
화르르르……!
거인의 불은 한 곳에 집중되더니, 성지한을 향해 뻗어 나갔다.
지금까지 보고 겪어 왔던 불의 힘 중에서는, 가장 강력한 화신의 일격.
이것은 명백히 성지한을 집어삼키려는 시도였다.
“성좌가 아니라고 할 때 반응이 이상하더니, 역시 이렇게 나오는군.”
[스스로 자신이 먹이라고 이야기했으니, 나로선 당연히 집어삼켜야지!]
“성좌가 아니면 먹이인가?”
[그래. 격이 낮은 존재는 신에게 지배당할 수밖에 없지.]
“흠…….”
어느덧 눈앞까지 다가온 샛노란 불꽃.
성지한은 손을 뻗어 이를 흡수하려 했다.
전 라운드처럼, 불의 기운이 손을 통해 적의 문양으로 모이나 싶었지만.
[언제까지 그 수법이 통할 것 같나!]
화르르르!
화신의 잔재 때 흡수당했던 걸 보고 미리 대비라도 한 건지.
불의 기운은 밖으로 빠져나와, 성지한의 전신을 태웠다.
조금 전처럼 손쉽게 흡수할 수는 없는 상황.
‘역시 한 가닥 하는군.’
과연 잔재랑은 다르다고 생각하며, 성지한은 적의 권능을 계속 운용했다.
마지막 단계, 적의 문양까지 넣을 수는 없어도.
자신의 몸을 불태우려는 불길을 컨트롤하는 건 가능했으니.
화신의 불꽃과 성지한은, 그렇게 서로를 집어삼키려 들면서 대치에 들어갔다.
그리고.
[이놈, 끈질기게 버티는군……! 정말로 관리자의 후계자인가!]
먼저 초조해진 건, 화신 쪽이었다.
[좋아. 몸은 후계자의 것으로 갈아타면 된다…… 전력을 다하겠다!]
푸스스스…….
불꽃 거인의 육신이 허물어지고.
성지한을 향해 뻗어 오는 불길의 힘이 더욱 강해지기 시작했다.
화신이었던 존재가, 자신의 몸을 허물어뜨리면서까지 성지한을 잡아 삼키려고 들자.
화르르륵!
적의 권능이 서서히 밀리면서, 성지한의 몸 여기저기가 불타올랐다.
일반 플레이어였다면, 바로 치명상에 이를 강력한 공격.
‘적만으로는 집어삼킬 수 없겠군.’
원래는 스탯 적에 저놈을 싹 다 집어삼키려고 했는데.
상대도 한때 신이었던 존재라 그런지, 그렇게 녹록치 않았다.
이러면 다른 권능도 사용을 해야 할 때.
성지한은 대치 와중, 새로이 무공을 펼쳤다.
혼원신공混元神功
멸신결滅神訣
천수강신天樹降神
타오른 육신이 순식간에 재생하고.
드르르륵!
성지한의 몸 안에서, 사슬이 튀어나왔다.
[아니, 잠깐. 그건 설마…….]
성지한의 사슬을 보고 불꽃이 잠시 공격을 멈췄을 때.
스으으윽!
보랏빛의 사슬은, 순식간에 불길에 감겨 이를 구속했다.
[네, 네가 이걸 어떻게…… 넌 적색의 관리자 후계 아니었나? 공허의 구속구를 어떻게 쓰지?]
“이거 공허 거였냐?”
[네, 네놈…… 날 놀리느냐? 그걸 왜 나에게 물어봐?]
“아니. 진짜 몰라서.”
목속성의 천수강신.
엘프처럼 몸도 재생시키고, 사슬도 내뿜으며.
이걸 뭉쳐 강철거인 엔키두도 만드는 길가메시의 권능은.
성지한에게 아직 완벽히 분석되지 않는 힘이었다.
하나 생명의 기운을 통해 운용되는 권능이라, 오히려 엘프랑 연관된 힘인가 생각했는데.
‘뜻밖의 곳에서 천수강신에 대해 알아가는군.’
성지한은 그렇게 생각하며 사슬을 더 강하게 조였다.
치이이익!
현실 세계라면 불꽃에 사슬이 감길 리가 없겠지만.
천수강신의 사슬은 겉모습만 금속일 뿐, 모든 것을 구속할 수 있었다.
‘화신이었던 자’는 그렇게 천수강신에 본격적으로 감기자, 평정을 잃은 듯 발악했다.
[아레나에서 나를 이것으로 잡아 왔으면서……! 그, 그래. 너. 이제 보니 아레나의 주인인가? 아니면 그의 끄나풀이겠구나. 날 가둔 것도 모자라, 배신할지 실험한 거야!]
“호오. 아레나의 주인도 사슬을 써?”
[이 자식이 어디까지 연기를……!]
성지한이 아레나의 주인과 연계되어 있다고 확신하는 듯한 화신.
‘반항이 줄었군.’
성지한은 두 눈에 이채를 띄었다.
자기 멋대로 성지한을 아레나의 주인 쪽이라고 착각한 ‘화신이었던 자’는.
전의를 잃었는지, 조금 전보다 기세가 급격히 약해져 있었다.
그러자 화신의 기운도 성지한의 운용에 더 쉽게 지배당하여.
적의 문양 안으로 빨려 들어갔다.
[화신의 기운을 흡수했습니다.]
[스탯 ‘적’이 1 오릅니다.]
전 라운드에선 화신의 잔재를 모조리 흡수해도 오를까 말까 했던 적의 기운이 금방 1이 오르는 걸 보며.
성지한은 입꼬리를 올린 채, 말문을 열었다.
“눈치가 빠르구나. 화신.”
*   *   *
[역시…… 네놈. 아레나의 주인이었는가?]
“그럴 리가.”
[그럼 그의 부하겠군. 부하가 이 정도라니. 그 괴물도 후계자를 양성하는 건가…… 어떻게 적의 언어까지 알아차린 거지?]
“후후. 글쎄.”
[……거기까진 알려 주지 않겠다는 건가.]
성지한이 그냥 추임새만 넣어도, 혼자서 예측하고 납득하는 ‘화신이었던 자’.
아레나 측에 당했다고 생각한 건지, 그의 전의는 급격히 떨어지고 있었다.
[화신의 기운을 흡수했습니다.]
[스탯 ‘적’이 1 오릅니다.]
‘자기 혼자 지레짐작해서, 흡수가 쉬워졌군.’
벌써 2가 올라, 10이 된 스탯 ‘적’.
숫자가 두 자리가 되자, 확실히 불의 기운을 운용하는 게 더 수월해졌다.
화신이 기운이 조금 전보다 훨씬 빨리 흡수되자.
불꽃은 정신을 차린 듯, 이리저리 일렁이며 발악했다.
[나, 날 본격적으로 집어삼키려 드는가……! 아레나의 주인. 네놈도 적색의 관리자 자리를 노리는 거군! 불의 힘을 집어삼켜, 관리자 경쟁에 뛰어들려고……!]
“후. 벌써 거기까지 깨달았는가…….”
상대의 착각.
굳이 교정해 줄 필요 없겠지.
성지한은 그냥 입으로는 가볍게 대꾸만 해 주면서, 화신을 쭉쭉 흡수해 나갔다.
[허. 공허가 관리자 자리까지 욕심부리다니. 부여받은 소명, 청소부 역할을 저버릴 셈인가……!]
“난 주인의 뜻에 따를 뿐.”
[큭…… 이, 이렇게 끝이 나다니! 왜 함정임을, 인지하지 못했던가…….]
천수강신에 감기자마자 전의를 잃었던 화신은.
그렇게 혼자 착각에 빠져, 힘 빠진 반항을 하다가 성지한의 문양에 모조리 흡수가 되었다.
[화신의 기운을 모두 흡수했습니다.]
[스탯 ‘적’이 2 오릅니다.]
‘승급전의 진정한 보상은 스탯이었군.’
화신을 잔재부터 본신까지, 뼈까지 다 발라먹은 성지한.
진입할 때만 해도 5였던 적 스탯은 12가 되어 있었다.
어찌 보면 화신 같은 강대한 존재를 삼킨 거치고는 스탯이 많이 안 오른 편에 속했지만.
‘저건 신이라기엔 불완전한 존재. 화신의 편린에 불과하니까. 이 정도만 해도 감지덕지지.’
성지한은 일단 이 정도에서 만족하기로 했다.
그때.
성지한의 눈앞에.
그 어떤 기척도 없이, 한 존재가 스르륵 떠올랐다.
인간형의, 성지한과 비슷한 눈높이를 지니고 있는 그 존재는.
단정한 양복을 입은 채, 검은 중절모를 쓰고 있었다.
다만.
‘얼굴이…… 우주야?’
사지는 멀쩡하게 다 있는데.
모자 아래, 얼굴은 별이 가득한 우주의 형상을 하고 있는 상대.
짝. 짝. 짝.
그는 성지한을 보더니, 크게 세 번 박수를 쳤다.
그러자.
스으으윽.
빛이 가득하던 경기장 사방이 어둠에 잠기면서.
이 공간에는 성지한과 우주 얼굴 둘만 남았다.
“놀랍군요. 제가 당신 주인이었다니.”
“당신이 아레나의 주인인가?”
“그렇습니다. 다음 시즌에 기대되는 스페이스 아레나의 루키로 누굴 선정할까 했는데…… 대형 유망주가 나왔군요.”
“신세를 졌군. 아까 잠깐 이름 좀 빌렸다.”
“후후. 괜찮습니다. 입으로 상대를 동요시키는 것도 루키에게 꼭 필요한 재능. 당한 화신이 등신이지요.”
아레나의 주인은 화신이 있던 곳을 바라보더니, 다시 성지한 쪽으로 고개를 돌렸다.
“어디. 그럼 루키 선정을 위한 기본 인적사항을 살펴볼까요.”
우주 배경의 별 중 푸른 별에서 빛이 뿜어져 나오고.
지이이잉…….
그 빛은 성지한의 몸을, 위아래로 쭉 스캔했다.
“NO.4212. ‘인류’ 출신이라…… 배신자 길가메시. 그가 속한 종족이군요.”
“배신자?”
“그렇습니다.”
스윽.
아레나의 주인이 얼굴을 손으로 쓸자.
우주 배경 얼굴이, 길가메시의 것으로 변했다.
“그는 공허의 소명을 저버린 배신자. 그의 원죄는 NO.4212 인류 모두가 갚아야 합니다.”
“그가 공허의 뭘 배신한 거지?”
“임무를 다 끝마친 그는, 주어진 수명을 누리고 죽었어야 했습니다. 하지만.”
파악!
길가메시의 얼굴이 부서지며, 다시 우주 배경이 드러났다.
“그는 죽지 않았죠. 그게, 배신입니다.”
“그거 가지고 배신이라니…….”
“이 이상은. 말씀드리기가 그렇군요.”
스윽.
아레나의 주인이 손을 펼치자.
[스페이스 아레나의 주인을 만났습니다.]
[에픽 퀘스트를 클리어했습니다.]
[스페이스 아레나의 루키로 선정됩니다.]
[성좌 후보자 기간이 100일 단축됩니다.]
에픽 퀘스트를 클리어했다는 메시지와 함께, 보상이 주르륵 떠올랐다.
‘실제로 강해지는 건 없군.’
오히려 화신을 집어삼키고 스탯 적 7을 얻은 게 더 큰 것 같은 에픽 퀘스트 보상.
성지한이 그렇게 메시지를 확인하고 있을 때.
“우리 루키께서는, 배틀넷에 대해 어떻게 생각하십니까?”
아레나의 주인이 성지한에게 물음을 던졌다.
“빠져나와야지.”
“NO.4212를 위해서요?”
“그래. 인류는 배틀넷에 적합한 종족이 아니야. 나 때문에 순항하는 거지.”
제3자가 보기엔 거만하기 짝이 없는 발언이었지만.
실제로, 인류의 상황은 성지한의 말 그대로였다.
“후후. 현실 파악이 잘되어 있으시군요.”
“…….”
“하나 길가메시가 살아 있는 한, 배틀넷의 초대장은 계속 날아들 겁니다. 배틀넷에서 벗어나고 싶다면…….”
스윽.
아레나의 주인의 얼굴이 길가메시로 다시 변하더니.
완전히 금이 가며, 파드득 깨졌다.
“길가메시를 죽이세요.”

Text 288:

[Epic Quest]
-Defeat the hidden existences and meet the owner of 'Space Arena'.
-Reward: Selected as the 'Rookie of Space Arena' for the next season.
-Shortening of the Constellation Candidate period.

'Rookie... It's a bit ambiguous.'

Seong Jihan slightly frowned while looking at the reward details of the epic quest.

It doesn't give any actual ability values, so what's good about becoming the rookie of the arena?

'Still, the shortening of the Constellation Candidate period is useful.'

With the characteristic of Chasing the Stars, one can become a Constellation Candidate by maintaining 1st place for 300 days.

Because of this condition, he thought he would become a Constellation Candidate next year at the earliest, but if he clears this epic quest, it seemed he could become a Constellation Candidate this year.

'Anyway, the conditions aren't difficult, so I should progress the quest while fighting the hidden existences.'

So when will the hidden existences appear?

Seong Jihan looked around with his arms crossed.

The stadium that was cleanly cleared by the intense flames that made the opposing players mistake it for a Dragon Breath.

The floor was charred black, but.

Beyond the stadium, the spectator seats stretching to the end of the sky were the same.

'The spectators of this arena only show light.'

There were no figures of lifeforms in the huge spectator seats, only circular halos of light floating and keeping their respective positions.

The halos of light that initially shone in various colors as if gathering all the colors of the world.

Flash...!

They emitted a strong light once, and all began to change to red.

And.

[Matching a suitable opponent for the player among the hidden existences...]

['Remnant of the Incarnation' is summoned.]

As a system message appeared in front of Seong Jihan's eyes.

Whoosh!

A huge flame soared in front of Seong Jihan.

[#[protected]$... @$!... ]

In the center of the stadium, the flames.

Inside, an unknown sound echoed.

I don't know what it's saying, but it's definitely a language.

'It's not translated by BattleNet either.'

Until now, BattleNet had translated all alien languages.

This time, it only sounded like an alien language.

Seong Jihan decided not to care about what the fire was saying and grasped the flames spreading to his side.

'Is it because it's the Remnant of the Incarnation? The firepower is considerable.'

This level is probably equivalent to the first Breath he was hit by when absorbing the power of the Dragon Heart.

The flames were so intense that if it were another player, their body would burn up in an instant without being able to endure for long, but.

'It doesn't work on Red.'

Seong Jihan, who had obtained the gradeless stat Red, easily controlled the fire.

The flames of the Incarnation were instantly absorbed into the Red pattern hidden on his chest.

[...[protected]$!]

Whoosh!

As Seong Jihan absorbed the fire, the flames soaring from the center turned bright yellow and the flames that were spreading in all directions gathered towards him, but.

'It's good that it comes on its own.'

Swish.

Seong Jihan lightly moved his hand and continued to absorb the fire.

-Seong Jihan is suddenly handling fire. Did he awaken the ability of fire while training this time?

-He used it before too when using red lightning, right?

-Back then, the lightning ability was the main one.

Meanwhile, viewers watching Seong Jihan's appearance through BattleTube and discussing whether he had obtained a new power.

Shwoosh!

As the flames that seemed to burn the entire stadium were quickly absorbed into Seong Jihan.

People felt at ease.

-Watching Seong Jihan's match after seeing mediocre players fight each other until two days ago is refreshing lol

-But honestly, the match two days ago had some thrill in terms of viewing pleasure...

-We don't need that kind of thrill. Winning is the best.

-For real, this is how the game should be.

Shwoosh...

Meanwhile, the Remnant of the Incarnation being rapidly sucked in by Red.

The flames that threatened Seong Jihan were gone.

The Remnant of the Incarnation that seemed to burn the entire stadium now only ignited flames in the center.

It was pitifully shooting out flames towards Seong Jihan, who was slowly walking.

However.

"You're enduring for a long time."

Pow!

Seong Jihan caught the flying flames as they were.

As soon as he grasped the fire, the flames were instantly absorbed into his body.

The power of fire accumulating bit by bit in the Red pattern like that.

'This... is quite a lot?'

At first, Seong Jihan was absorbing the power of fire just to try handling the Red stat, but.

When the flames emitted by the Remnant of the Incarnation were unexpectedly plentiful, his eyes shone.

'This might...'

Thump. Thump.

Seong Jihan quickly walked towards the Remnant of the Incarnation.

The closer he got, the more fiercely the flames rose and tried to block his path, but.

Shwoosh!

Seong Jihan sucked in the fire with his palm and approached near the center.

And standing tall in front of the yellow flames, he.

"Hey. Try more."

Click. Click.

He provoked the Remnant of the Incarnation by moving his fingers.

Whoosh!

Then, as if enraged, a pillar of fire soaring up to the sky.

The Remnant of the Incarnation exerted its power to the fullest and resisted Seong Jihan, but.

'Nice.'

Seong Jihan was rather pleased and sucked in all the fire.

Then, the power of fire rapidly accumulating in the Red pattern.

He just stood there and continued to absorb the fire.

-It's like replaying the same scene over and over lol

-Why is he just standing still? Finish it.

-Isn't he absorbing the fire?

-Definitely, the results of training seem to be fire.

While viewers were evaluating like that, watching Seong Jihan stretch out his palm and collect the flames for dozens of minutes.

[The power of the Incarnation has been absorbed.]

[Stat 'Red' increases by 1.]

'Oho... Finally.'

Seong Jihan's eyes sparkled at the message that appeared.

Just in case, he waited even though he could subdue the Remnant of the Incarnation at once, but.

He was able to raise the stat for free from an unexpected place.

'It's not being absorbed into the pattern anymore.'

After the stat increased by 1, the power of fire that was sucked in was no longer accumulating in the pattern.

He had already devoured it all.

Seong Jihan regretted not being able to raise the stat anymore, and.

'Shall I finish it now?'

He was about to end the game.

Then.

[You... are the successor of the administrator?]

The words of the Remnant of the Incarnation that couldn't be heard until now were translated.

*   *   *

Swish.

Seong Jihan, who was about to stretch out his hand and end the Remnant of the Incarnation, stopped moving for a moment at those words.

The words that couldn't be heard are now audible.

Is it because he perfectly absorbed its fire to the point of raising the stat?

[Can you hear my words...!?]

As Seong Jihan stopped his hand for a moment, the flames flickered and hurriedly spoke.

"Yeah."

[Are you really the successor of the administrator! Ple-please annihilate me here...!]

As soon as he understood the words, the Remnant of the Incarnation asked him to kill it.

"I was going to get rid of you anyway."

[No, even if you get rid of this fire... I won't die. You have to draw out the main body.]

"How do I draw out the main body?"

[Like when you summoned me earlier. Ignite intense flames. Then my remnants will continue to be summoned. As you suppress them, in the end, the main body will be summoned in the arena to suppress you with fire.]

"Hmm."

As soon as he was summoned to the Space Arena, Seong Jihan swept away all the opponents with the ability of Red.

The power that worked at that time was purely the power of fire.

Was that the condition to summon the hidden existence, the Remnant of the Incarnation?

"What happens if I use something other than fire?"

[Then, the remnants of other gods will be summoned... The fragments of dead gods bound to the arena, like me.]

"So that was the summoning condition."

[That's right. So, please draw out the power of fire and annihilate me...!]

Seong Jihan blankly stared at the Remnant of the Incarnation who was desperate to die.

"Why do you want to die?"

[...I am in a state of being eternally bound to the Space Arena. The only way to escape from this damn place is through death.]

"Hmm."

To be liberated from the Space Arena, he's saying he'll die?

Even though he heard those words, Seong Jihan didn't fully believe them at face value.

The alien beings he met in the Space League.

Whether they were gods or not, they were all untrustworthy.

Didn't the Thunder God also try to backstab him but ended up being suppressed instead?

'But if I can raise stats by absorbing other Remnants of Incarnation. That seems worth it.'

The Red stat that had now become 6.

Each single value of this stat held important value.

This time, he absorbed the Remnant of the Incarnation to the point where the stat wouldn't increase anymore, but.

If a new Remnant of Incarnation is summoned, he might be able to raise the stat by one more for free.

While Seong Jihan decided to summon one more for now.

"What will you do for me?"

[What...]

"You're not thinking of requesting a job for free, are you?"

He demanded compensation from the Remnant of the Incarnation.

[Didn't you absorb my power? Successor of the administrator.]

"That's my ability. You have to give me something separately."

[Something to give... I am the remnant of a god bound to the arena. All I have to give is this fire.]

"No GP or items either?"

[How would I have such things...! Even if I obtain them by chance, the owner of the arena takes them all back!]

Seong Jihan clicked his tongue.

He had a hunch since it said it was bound to the Space Arena, but.

It really seems to be penniless.

However.

'It's not like there's nothing to gain at all.'

Even from the Remnant of the Incarnation in such a slave state.

Seong Jihan found something to be compensated with.

"Okay. Then give me information about the 'owner of the arena'. And about this Space Arena. I'll grant your wish with that."

[Information... D-Did you come here without knowing?]

"Yeah. I came to take the promotion match."

[Promotion match... You're not a constellation?]

Whoosh!

Flames soared from the Remnant of the Incarnation.

His voice became more urgent than before.

[Even though you're not a constellation, you're at this level... G-Good. I'll tell you. I'll definitely tell you. So summon me.]

"You'll give the information in advance?"

[...If I mention the owner of the arena, I'll draw his attention. I'll tell you when you summon the main body.]

"Hmm."

Seong Jihan's eyes sank coldly.

The Remnant of the Incarnation, revealing an excited look as soon as it learned he wasn't a constellation.

This guy.

Seems to have ulterior motives like the Thunder God.

However.

'I can't miss the chance to raise stats.'

Regardless of the Remnant of the Incarnation's scheme.

Seong Jihan was confident he could suppress it.

"Got it. I'll go up using only fire."

[Good...! Then first, kill this remnant.]

"Yeah."

Shwoosh...

As Seong Jihan reached out his hand, the Remnant of the Incarnation that had been enduring for a long time disappeared at once.

[The hidden existence 'Remnant of the Incarnation' has been suppressed.]

[After promotion, the level increases by 3.]

[The Constellation Candidate period is shortened by 3 days.]

'3 days is too little.'

The reward given just for suppressing a hidden existence.

The level 3 increase was good, but the latter reward was not very satisfactory.

'But if I keep suppressing hidden existences, I can significantly shorten the period.'

[Advancing to the next round.]

And the 2nd round began.

[Even such a race advanced?]

[You have good matchup luck. For such a lowly race to rise to the 2nd round...]

[That guy is my prey. Don't touch him.]

Seong Jihan, newly summoned to the stadium.

He felt huge beings looking down on him.

Maybe because they all survived and rose from the previous match.

Players boasting a much stronger presence than in the 1st round.

-How many dragon-level monster races are there...

-How are human races supposed to compete in BattleNet when matched with such guys?

-It's really becoming a monster battle as it goes on...

The viewers were momentarily discouraged upon seeing such giant monsters, but.

"No time."

Flames ignited at Seong Jihan's fingertips.

Whoosh!

As the conflagration instantly covered the stadium.

-Comfortable.

-They get swept in one go lol

-Why are they matched with Seong Jihan?

The sense of threat from the size was only momentary.

They felt the comfort of Seong Jihan's channel once again.

And.

['Remnant of the Incarnation' is summoned.]

The Remnant of the Incarnation being summoned like before.

He repeated the process of being absorbed by Seong Jihan like earlier.

Like that, several matches proceeded similarly.

[Advancing to the 5th round.]

[It is the final round.]

As they entered the final round.

Finally, a change occurred.

Text 287:

The guild channel where over 100 million people gathered before the broadcast started.

As Seong Jihan revealed his face.

-Oh, he really returned?

-Where the hell have you been and what have you been doing?

The speed at which the number of viewers increased was exponentially fast.

"Jihan. First... Ah. We have now surpassed 150 million viewers. Please greet the viewers."

The guild channel broadcast progressing in an interview format.

The interviewer was Lee Hayeon.

"I apologize for not being able to participate in yesterday's match."

At the request to greet, Seong Jihan slightly lowered his head in front of the camera.

As soon as he apologized, the chat window that was already exploding.

The atmosphere began to intensify with a mix of support and criticism for Seong Jihan.

-No, why are you apologizing, Mr. Jihan? There can be times when you can't participate in a match!

-Look at him barely lowering his head, is that an apology?!

-No, the problem is the human national team that lost to the last place team.

-I don't feel any sense of responsibility from the rank 1. What will you do if dungeons appear in our land...!

-Seong Jihan, take responsibility!

Mainly Koreans were supporting Seong Jihan, while foreigners were criticizing him.

Lee Hayeon glanced at the chat window and asked Seong Jihan.

"Jihan... Many people were worried that you didn't return. Did something happen during that time?"

While asking that question, Lee Hayeon was desperately sending eye signals to Seong Jihan at an angle not visible on camera.

It was a gesture asking him to answer well somehow because the reaction was too bad, but.

"Ah. I was late because I was training."

Seong Jihan didn't pay attention to it.

"Training...?"

"Yes."

At that answer, the chat window exploded even more.

-Training? You were late just because of training?

-Even after becoming rank 1, he trains like that, so humanity has been continuously benefiting from Seong Jihan.

-That's right. Most other rankers are busy playing around after becoming celebrities. How many players are there who only train like Seong Jihan?

-Still, you have to keep the schedule! What if you miss a match!

-Yeah. Will you still say that even if a dungeon portal appears in your home?

-No, we're still in 7th place, so it's not that serious of a situation. The exaggeration of foreigners is really...

-Then you don't think about the number of wins Seong Jihan has earned for us so far?

-Seeing that we lost even to the league's last place, it seems we would have been last if Seong Jihan wasn't there.

-Lol for real

As support and criticism for Seong Jihan intertwined, chaos unfolded.

Lee Hayeon glanced at it and asked Seong Jihan again.

"Um, may I ask what kind of training took you so long?"

While sending eye signals again this time.

Not only her, but Yoon Seah, who was watching this behind the camera, was also moving her lips saying 'Please. Please.' to Seong Jihan.

'They're more worried than me.'

Seong Jihan himself didn't mind receiving a little more criticism, but.

Because the people around him were so worried, he decided to tell one reason for being late.

"There was something I had to finish in order to challenge a constellation. I was a bit late because I was completing that."

"Constellation... I knew it. Of course. There's no way Jihan would be absent for no reason!"

Lee Hayeon immediately responded to Seong Jihan's answer.

-Yeah, would Seong Jihan be absent for no reason? There must be a reason.

-If it's a challenge to a constellation, is it related to the battle during the Russia match?

-No, isn't it because of the Constellation Candidate thing?

-Still, you should have come out for a day to participate in the Space League :(

-The Constellation thing is ultimately a personal matter, right? For the greater good, he should have come out.

-How much did Seong Jihan earn for us during the planet colonization... Wow, this is really absurd.

-When he became healthy, everyone praised him, but now they're talking nonsense because he couldn't come out once due to training...

Seong Jihan's supporters raised their voices at that answer, but.

Still, there were more voices condemning him.

In a situation where the aftermath of the human national team's first defeat had not yet subsided.

The reason Seong Jihan gave was difficult to convince everyone.

"Ah..."

"Hmm, there are more critical opinions."

At this reaction from people, the guild officials couldn't hide their worried looks, but.

'After saving a drowning person, they demand to hand over the bundle too.'

Seong Jihan, who knew humanity's performance in his previous life, found this reaction just ridiculous.

He stared intently at the chat window with sunken eyes.

The criticism from foreigners, far more than the support from his own countrymen.

Looking at that, he slowly opened his mouth.

"Many people are telling me to take responsibility. Hmm... How should I take responsibility?"

"That's..."

"Should I stop training? But I have to train because I'm facing many problems. If I can't give up training. Hmm... Should I give up the Space League for the time being?"

"What? J-Jihan. That's...!"

As Seong Jihan said that with his arms crossed.

-What, he's going to be absent from the Space League? Are you really going to do it?

-Do it. What are you going to do? Withdraw from the Daegi guild? There are many countries aiming for the empty spot.

-In the first place... Isn't the problem the human national team that got beaten by the 20th place? Why are you stepping up and 
putting the responsibility of the defeat on Seong Jihan?

-Go and say something to the players of your own country. Shouldn't you at least win against the last place?

Like pouring oil on a burning fire, the chat window was burning like crazy.

However, that reaction was only for a moment.

[A.DaVVies has sponsored 100,000 GP.]

[Player Seong Jihan!! This defeat is entirely my responsibility as the coach. Giving up on the Space League... Please! No!]

[KING.JEFF has sponsored 100,000 GP.]

[The World BattleNet Association fully supports player Seong Jihan. The decision to participate in matches is the player's unique authority, and excessive criticism regarding this should be refrained from.]

Following the coach of the human national team, even the president of the World BattleNet Association stepped up to sponsor the guild channel and send a message.

When criticism was pouring on Seong Jihan, the BattleNet leadership was going to watch for now without intervening, but.

"What...! Giving up on the Space League?"

"No, no matter how much they caught him, they should criticize moderately...! They're really crossing the line."

"Seong Jihan. This person is someone who will really do it if he says he will."

"We need to calm the situation quickly. What if he really boycotts a few Space League games?"

As soon as he expressed his intention to possibly be absent for a while, they were startled and quickly began to resolve the situation.

Not only President Jeff or Coach Davis.

Sponsorships from BattleNet federation presidents and guild representatives from all over the world began to pour in.

-Wow... Look at the list of sponsors; all the successful guilds are sending

-Only Seong Jihan can collect GP like this even after being absent from a match lol

-No. Seong Jihan... He couldn't come because he was training, so why is he receiving sponsorships? :(

-Even the president of your country sponsored saying to stop... Do you want him to shoot again?

The criticism that was rapidly losing strength as soon as Seong Jihan brought up being absent from the Space League.

Especially when even the leaders of each country stepped up to relay sponsorships.

The critical chats in the chat window were now definitely being pushed back by supportive chats.

-Wow... It's clear who the boss is today

-Yesterday's defeat made us realize humanity's dependence on Seong Jihan instead.

-For real, we didn't expect to lose to the 20th place.

-But the leaders are quick at judging the situation lol

Seong Jihan looked around at these reactions and slightly lowered his head once more.

"Since many people I owe, including the coach, are saying that... I will diligently participate in the Space League. I caused concern to everyone with unnecessary words."

Seong Jihan, who brought up giving up Space League matches once and settled the situation.

"Then, I will see you again at the promotion match."

Ended the broadcast with a calm face.

*   *   *

[Reason for absence from Space League is training? Soaring criticism resolved with one word.]

[Sponsorships pouring in after declaring match absence. Top 100 guilds in the world all support Seong Jihan.]

[Where did you return unscathed? Seong Jihan's presence strengthened even more through the match with Zojin.]

The short interview with Seong Jihan that took place on the Daegi guild channel.

This only revealed how much humanity relied on Seong Jihan.

Humanity's leadership, who hurriedly supported Seong Jihan and requested reconsideration as soon as he brought up a match boycott.

People watched this in real-time and clearly felt who was in the position of needing the other.

"Uncle's criticism. It decreased a lot."

"Why are you even going to foreign sites to check that?"

"It's amazing how people's reactions change so drastically like this."

Korean portal sites were originally full of praise for Seong Jihan anyway.

Yoon Seah had several foreign sites open, even using a translator to examine people's reactions.

"Leave it. If they criticize, let them criticize."

"Uncle... For someone who doesn't care much. You even brought up a match boycott."

"I just brought it up once. Did you think I would really not participate?"

"The Association responded so swiftly thinking you really wouldn't participate."

Seong Jihan smiled at Yoon Seah's words.

The BattleNet Association and the top 100 guilds.

They must have had time differences with Korea, but their response speed was tremendous.

'Fortunately, they recognize that they are the ones who need me.'

The defeat in the match against the 20th-ranked Zojin.

It seemed to have given a bigger shock to the BattleNet Association and humanity's leadership than the general public, so the world's leaders were more mindful of Seong Jihan's mood than before.

Seong Jihan was a player who would quietly train and gain strength and repay humanity with results as long as they didn't provoke him first anyway.

It seemed they had agreed to support the rank 1 as smoothly as possible.

"Is Uncle's promotion match today?"

"Yeah."

"It's humanity's first."

"Aren't there more people who reached level 300?"

"Yeah. The level doesn't rise much? I don't know if there will be level 300 achievers until next month."

The promotion match held when the tutorial ends and the max level expands.

Even at the end of May, there was only one player, Seong Jihan, challenging the league above Diamond, the Master League.

'No matter how many growth bonuses have been added compared to before, it doesn't seem easy.'

The BattleNet game where matching with alien races also began after entering the Space League.

When playing games with alien races, humanity's win rate was below 50 percent.

Because there were so many situations where experience decreased instead of increasing.

Even though quite a lot of time was given, players other than Seong Jihan had not yet reached level 300.

"Then I'll go and come back."

Seong Jihan waved his hand to Yoon Seah and logged into BattleNet.

[The Master League promotion match will proceed.]

[There is only one player who has met the promotion match conditions within the race 'Humanity'.]

[The promotion match will be held in the Space League.]

Flash!

As soon as he logged into the game, Seong Jihan was transferred to the Space League.

Since there were no competitors among human players to take the promotion match together, it was a natural result in a way.

[The game will take place in the survival map, 'Space Arena'.]

As soon as that message appeared, Seong Jihan was summoned somewhere.

Flash!

Light entered his vision, and the surroundings came into view.

'It's similar to the Colosseum I fought in before.'

A stadium similar to the arena map he experienced in Bronze before, but ten times larger in scale.

Inside, various races were preparing for battle while glaring at each other.

'Isn't it a special map this time?'

Because he had only experienced special maps in promotion matches.

Seong Jihan was rather unfamiliar with regular promotion matches now.

Then the rewards would be less compared to special maps.

'Well, I can't eat a special meal every day. Shall I finish it quickly?'

Seong Jihan put aside his regret.

He took out his sword and spear.

In an instant, a fierce energy rose.

[Hmm...]

[That guy?]

[Tremendous strength...]

The gazes of the players who were wary of each other all gathered on Seong Jihan at once.

He smiled at them and turned on BattleTube.

"Everyone. Let me show you the results of my training."

Whoosh.

A small flame rose from the tip of the spear.

[Ah, no, what is that. It doesn't make sense!]

[This is...]

A huge conflagration covered the stadium in an instant.

[Dragon... Breath?!]

With those last words, the opposing players were annihilated.

Maybe because it was a regular promotion match, the game was also one-sided.

'Too easy. Is this the shortest time?'

After annihilating the enemies in one shot, Seong Jihan, who was waiting for the game to end.

[The match ended too quickly, so the next opponent has not been decided.]

[Do you want to face the 'Hidden Existence'?]

His eyes shone upon seeing the message that suddenly appeared.

'Hidden Existence...'

As he pressed yes.

An epic quest popped up.
